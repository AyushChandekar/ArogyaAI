Abdominal Hernia,An abdominal hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle or connective tissue (fascia) in the abdominal wall.,"A combination of muscle weakness and strain. Weakness can be congenital or develop over time. Strain can result from heavy lifting, chronic coughing, obesity, or straining during bowel movements.","A visible bulge or lump in the abdomen or groin, which may ache, burn, or disappear when lying down. Pain may occur when lifting, coughing, or straining.","Maintain a healthy weight, eat a high-fiber diet to avoid constipation, lift heavy objects correctly using your legs, and avoid smoking to prevent chronic coughing.","DISCLAIMER: These are supportive measures only and DO NOT cure a hernia, which often requires surgery. Consult a doctor. Gentle core-strengthening exercises (as advised by a doctor), avoiding abdominal strain, and consuming anti-inflammatory foods like ginger or turmeric may help with discomfort.","Hernias do not resolve on their own and can enlarge. A ""strangulated"" hernia, where the blood supply to the trapped tissue is cut off, is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate surgery.","WHO includes hernia repair in its list of essential surgical procedures. Their focus is on improving access to safe, affordable, and timely surgery as part of strengthening health systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries."
Abdominal Injury,"Damage to the structures within the abdomen, such as the stomach, intestines, liver, or spleen. It can be blunt (from impact) or penetrating (from a wound).","Common causes include vehicle accidents, falls, physical assaults (blunt trauma), or stabbings and gunshot wounds (penetrating trauma).","Severe abdominal pain, tenderness, bruising, swelling, nausea, vomiting (sometimes with blood), and signs of shock (pale skin, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure).","Wearing seatbelts, using appropriate safety gear during sports, following workplace safety rules, and avoiding violent situations can help prevent abdominal injuries.","DISCLAIMER: Abdominal injury is a medical emergency. There are NO home treatments. Seek immediate medical attention. While waiting for help, have the person lie still and stay warm. Do not give them anything to eat or drink. Do not remove any penetrating objects.",Internal bleeding is a major risk and can be life-threatening even without visible external wounds. Any significant blow to the abdomen requires a medical evaluation.,WHO's guidelines on trauma care emphasize a systematic approach to assessment and management and the need for well-organized trauma care systems to reduce mortality and disability from injuries.
Abscess,"A painful, localized collection of pus, usually caused by a bacterial infection. An abscess can form on the skin surface or inside the body.","Bacteria (most commonly Staphylococcus) enter the body through a minor wound or blocked gland. The body's immune system responds, and the resulting battle creates pus.","A swollen, red, warm, and painful lump. Skin abscesses may come to a head and drain. Internal abscesses can cause fever, pain, and general unwellness.","Practice good hygiene, including regular handwashing. Clean any breaks in the skin thoroughly. Avoid sharing personal items like towels and razors.","DISCLAIMER: Do not squeeze or drain an abscess at home, as this can spread the infection. Consult a doctor. For a small skin abscess, applying a warm, moist compress for 20-30 minutes several times a day can encourage it to drain on its own.","An abscess is the body's attempt to wall off an infection. While small skin abscesses may resolve with warm compresses, larger ones and all internal abscesses require medical drainage by a doctor.","WHO provides guidelines on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) and the rational use of antibiotics, which are key to preventing and treating the bacterial infections that cause abscesses."
Achalasia,A rare disorder that makes it difficult for food and liquid to pass from the esophagus into the stomach. It occurs when nerves in the esophagus are damaged.,"The exact cause is unknown, but it's thought to be an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the nerve cells in the esophagus.","Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), regurgitating undigested food, chest pain, heartburn, and gradual weight loss.",There are no known precautions to prevent achalasia as the cause is unknown. Management focuses on treating the symptoms.,"DISCLAIMER: Achalasia requires medical diagnosis and treatment. These tips may help manage symptoms but do not cure the condition. Consult a doctor. Eating slowly, chewing food thoroughly, drinking plenty of water with meals, and avoiding eating late at night can help.","Achalasia is a progressive disorder. While not life-threatening, it can severely impact quality of life and nutrition. It requires a specific diagnosis and medical procedures or surgery to manage.","WHO does not have specific guidelines for achalasia due to its rarity. It falls under the broad category of non-communicable digestive diseases, for which WHO supports strengthening diagnostic and treatment capacity within health systems."
Acinic Cell Carcinoma,"A rare type of salivary gland cancer. It most commonly occurs in the parotid gland, the largest salivary gland, located in front of the ears.",The exact cause is unknown. It is not linked to common cancer risk factors like smoking or alcohol. Prior radiation exposure to the head and neck area may be a risk factor.,"Usually presents as a slow-growing, often painless lump in the area of the parotid gland (in the cheek or below the earlobe). Facial pain or weakness can occur if the tumor affects nearby nerves.",There are no known specific precautions to prevent this cancer due to its unknown cause. Avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to the head and neck is a general cancer prevention measure.,"DISCLAIMER: Cancer requires professional medical treatment. There are NO effective home treatments. Supportive care at home may include eating soft, moist foods if swallowing is difficult and maintaining good oral hygiene, as directed by the medical team.","This is a low-grade (slow-growing) cancer with a generally good prognosis after surgical removal. However, it can recur and sometimes spread to other parts of the body, so long-term follow-up is essential.","WHO's cancer control programs (e.g., through the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC) focus on research, surveillance, and prevention of common cancers. For rare cancers, the focus is on improving diagnosis and access to specialized treatment."
Acne,Acne is a common skin condition where hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. It affects people of all ages but is most common in teenagers.,"Overproduction of oil (sebum), clogged pores, bacteria (Cutibacterium acnes), hormonal changes, certain medications, and lifestyle factors.","Whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, cysts, redness, and possible scarring.","bath twice,avoid fatty spicy food,drink plenty of water,avoid too many products","coconut water 3-4 times a day. Have a plateful of watermelon (Clean face with cotton wool dipped in rose water 2-3 times a day. Do not use soap. Orange peel is very good in the treatment of acne. Grind the peel with some water to a paste and apply on affected parts. when oranges are not in season, you may use a powder of dried orange peels. For this, when oranges are in season, dry orange peels in shade. Powder finely in a grinder and sift it to make it a very fine powder. Store in an air tight bottle for future use. Mix 1 teaspoon lemon juice in 1 teaspoon finely ground cinnamon (dalchini) powder and apply on affected areas frequently. Sift the cinnamon (dalchini) powder to make it into a very fine powder. Crush a fegarlic (lasan) flakes and apply on the face, once or twice a day. Swallowing 1-2 flakes of ragarlic regularly helps further. Grind some neem leaves with water to a fine paste. Apply on infected area. Make a paste of Â½ teaspoon each of sandalwood and turmeric (haldi) powder in a little water and apply.",Acne is not caused by poor hygiene; it is manageable with proper care. Severe or persistent acne should be evaluated by a dermatologist.,"WHO highlights skin health as part of general well-being and recommends early care, awareness programs, and reducing stigma related to skin conditions."
Actinic Keratosis,"A rough, scaly patch on the skin that develops from years of exposure to the sun. It is most commonly found on the face, lips, ears, scalp, neck, or back of the hands.",Caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds.,"A rough, dry, or scaly patch, typically less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. It can be flat or slightly raised and may be pink, red, or brown. It can sometimes be itchy or tender.","Limit sun exposure, especially during peak hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). Use broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF, wear protective clothing, including wide-brimmed hats, and avoid tanning beds.",DISCLAIMER: Actinic keratosis must be evaluated by a doctor as it can progress to cancer. Home care is for prevention only. Regular skin self-exams to notice any new or changing spots.,"Actinic keratosis is considered a precancerous condition. If left untreated, a small percentage can develop into squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. Early detection and treatment are important.",WHO promotes sun safety as a key public health message to prevent skin cancer. This includes education on the risks of excessive UV exposure and promoting protective measures like sunscreen and shade.
Acute Bronchospasm,"A sudden constriction of the muscles in the walls of the bronchioles (the small airways in the lungs), causing difficulty in breathing. It is a key feature of asthma and can occur in other respiratory conditions.","Common triggers include allergens (pollen, dust), irritants (smoke, chemical fumes), respiratory infections, cold air, and strenuous exercise. It is the primary event in an asthma attack.","Sudden onset of wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness.","For individuals with asthma or other known respiratory conditions, the main precaution is to avoid known triggers and to use prescribed controller medications regularly.",DISCLAIMER: Acute bronchospasm can be a medical emergency. Use your prescribed rescue inhaler as directed. Seek immediate medical help if breathing does not improve. Inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water or a hot shower may help relax the airways while waiting for medical care.,This is a potentially life-threatening event as it can severely restrict airflow. People with conditions like asthma should always have a rescue inhaler available and an action plan for when to seek emergency care.,"WHO's strategy for chronic respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, focuses on ensuring access to essential medicines like rescue inhalers (short-acting beta-agonists) and promoting self-management education, including how to respond to acute attacks."
Acute Otitis Media,"An infection and inflammation of the middle ear, the air-filled space behind the eardrum. It is very common in young children.","It is usually caused by bacteria or viruses, often following a common cold, flu, or allergy that causes congestion and swelling of the nasal passages and eustachian tubes.","Ear pain (often severe), fever, fluid draining from the ear, a feeling of fullness in the ear, and muffled hearing. Young children may be irritable and pull at their ears.","Prevent common colds through frequent handwashing, keep vaccinations up to date (especially the pneumococcal vaccine), avoid exposure to secondhand smoke, and breastfeed infants.","DISCLAIMER: Ear infections should be diagnosed by a doctor, especially in children. These measures are for symptom relief only. Applying a warm, moist cloth over the affected ear. Using over-the-counter pain relievers like paracetamol or ibuprofen. Propping the child up to help with drainage.","While many ear infections resolve on their own, some require antibiotics. Recurrent or untreated infections can lead to hearing problems, a ruptured eardrum, or other complications.","WHO includes the management of acute otitis media in its guidelines for the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI). The guidelines help primary health workers diagnose and treat common childhood conditions, including appropriate use of antibiotics."
Acute Pancreatitis,"Acute pancreatitis is a temporary, sudden inflammation of the pancreas, which is a small organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and hormones like insulin. This inflammation occurs when the digestive enzymes are prematurely activated inside the pancreas, causing them to attack and damage the organ itself. Most cases are mild and resolve completely, but severe cases can lead to serious, life-threatening complications involving organ failure (e.g., kidney, lung, heart).","The two most common causes are gallstones (which block the duct leading from the pancreas) and heavy alcohol consumption. Other causes include: high triglyceride levels, certain medications (e.g., some antibiotics, chemotherapy, diuretics), abdominal trauma, high calcium levels, infections (viral/bacterial), and genetic disorders.","Severe upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, rapid pulse, swollen and tender abdomen, jaundice","The primary preventive measures involve lifestyle changes, especially if the cause is identified: **Stop drinking alcohol** (even small amounts can worsen the condition). **Quit smoking**. Maintain a **low-fat diet** with plenty of fruits and vegetables to reduce the risk of gallstone formation and help the pancreas recover. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Manage underlying conditions like high triglycerides and high calcium levels.","Acute pancreatitis is a medical emergency and **requires immediate hospitalization** for diagnosis and treatment. Home treatment is not appropriate. Hospital treatment focuses on supportive care: intravenous (IV) fluids to prevent dehydration, strong pain-relief medication, and temporary rest for the pancreas (initially by not eating or drinking). Once the patient is able, a low-fat diet is usually started.","Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention; symptoms like sudden, severe abdominal pain can mimic other emergencies like a heart attack. Early diagnosis and supportive care are crucial for preventing severe complications, which can include organ failure, infection, and tissue death (necrosis) in the pancreas. Recurrence can be prevented by addressing the underlying cause (e.g., removing the gallbladder if gallstones are the cause).","While the WHO does not provide specific step-by-step home treatment guidelines for acute pancreatitis (as it requires hospital care), their general health frameworks emphasize the importance of addressing major risk factors like **harmful use of alcohol** and **unhealthy diets** as part of preventing non-communicable diseases. WHO also advocates for effective management of conditions like gallstones and prompt access to essential medical services for acute emergencies."
Acute Sinusitis,"Acute sinusitis is an inflammation and swelling of the tissues lining the sinuses (air-filled spaces inside the nose and face) that typically lasts for less than four weeks. This swelling blocks the sinuses, preventing mucus from draining and leading to a buildup that causes pressure and discomfort. The condition is most often caused by the common cold (a viral infection)."," Most cases (viral acute sinusitis) are caused by **viral upper respiratory infections**, such as the **common cold**. Sometimes, the blockage leads to a secondary **bacterial infection** (acute bacterial sinusitis). Other risk factors include: **allergies** (hay fever), **nasal polyps** or tumors, a **deviated nasal septum** or other anatomical issues, **smoking** or exposure to secondhand smoke, and a **weakened immune system**.","Facial pain or pressure, nasal congestion, thick nasal discharge, post-nasal drip, cough, headache, fatigue, fever (in some cases)"," Maintain good hygiene, especially **washing hands often**, to avoid catching colds and other respiratory infections. **Manage allergies** with appropriate treatment. **Avoid cigarette smoke** and polluted air. **Use a clean humidifier** or vaporizer to add moisture to dry air. Stay current on recommended **vaccines** (e.g., flu, pneumococcal).","Use a **saline nasal spray or nasal rinse** (like a Neti pot) to flush out mucus and relieve congestion. Apply a **warm compress** over the nose and forehead to ease facial pain. **Inhale steam** from a hot shower or a bowl of hot water. **Drink plenty of fluids** (especially hot ones like tea or water with lemon) to thin mucus. Get **extra rest**. Over-the-counter decongestants and pain relievers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) can help with symptoms, but do not use medicated nasal decongestant sprays for more than 3-5 days to avoid rebound congestion.","Most acute sinusitis is viral and resolves on its own within 7 to 10 days; **antibiotics are ineffective** for viral cases. Seek medical attention if symptoms **last longer than 10 days** without improvement, if symptoms initially improve then **get worse** ('double-sickening'), or if you have **severe symptoms** like high fever, confusion, stiff neck, or vision changes (which may indicate a serious complication).","The World Health Organization (WHO) and other global health bodies emphasize that acute sinusitis is mostly viral and self-limiting. They recommend **symptomatic relief** (saline rinses, pain relievers) and advocate for **watchful waiting** before prescribing antibiotics to limit unnecessary use, which contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotics are generally reserved for cases strongly suggesting a bacterial infection (e.g., severe symptoms or symptoms lasting over 10 days)."
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma,"A rare form of cancer that most commonly develops in the salivary glands but can also occur in other areas, such as the throat, tear glands, or uterus.","The exact cause is unknown. It is not associated with smoking, alcohol use, or viral infections. It involves a specific genetic translocation in the tumor cells.","Symptoms depend on the location. In salivary glands, it may be a slow-growing lump with pain or facial numbness. In the airway, it can cause breathing or swallowing difficulties.",There are no known precautions to prevent this rare cancer as the cause is not understood.,DISCLAIMER: Cancer requires professional medical treatment. There are NO effective home treatments. Supportive care at home focuses on managing symptoms and side effects of treatment as guided by the medical team.,"This cancer is known for its slow growth but also for its high likelihood of recurring years later and spreading along nerves. Long-term, diligent follow-up with a medical team is crucial.","WHO and IARC conduct research and surveillance on all cancers, including rare types. The focus is on improving diagnostic methods, understanding the genetic basis of the disease, and developing more effective treatments."
Alcohol Intoxication,"Alcohol intoxication is a temporary physiological and psychological state caused by consuming ethanol (alcohol) faster than the liver can process it. This results in an elevated blood alcohol concentration (BAC), which impairs brain function, coordination, and judgment. Severe intoxication can lead to alcohol poisoning, a life-threatening medical emergency.","The primary cause is the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The severity of intoxication is influenced by the amount and speed of alcohol consumption, the individual's body weight, gender, age, metabolism, food intake before drinking, and overall health condition.","Slurred speech, impaired coordination, confusion","stop alcohol consumption,consult doctor,medication,Supportive care, ensuring hydration, monitoring vital signs, prevention of complications","For mild intoxication, the only cure is time for the body to metabolize the alcohol. Stop all alcohol consumption. Drink water to prevent dehydration. Rest in a safe place. If someone is vomiting, help them sit up or lie on their side to prevent choking. **Note: Unconsciousness, slow breathing, or seizures are signs of alcohol poisoning and require immediate emergency medical attention (call an ambulance). Do not leave an unconscious person alone.**","Alcohol intoxication significantly impairs judgment and increases the risk of accidents, injuries, violence, and risky behaviors. Binge drinking is a major cause of life-threatening alcohol poisoning. Long-term harmful use of alcohol can lead to chronic diseases, including liver damage, heart disease, and cancer, as well as alcohol dependence.","WHO identifies the harmful use of alcohol as a leading risk factor for poor health globally, contributing to millions of deaths each year. It promotes policies to reduce alcohol-related harm, such as increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, restricting alcohol advertising, and enforcing drink-driving laws. WHO's global strategy aims to reduce the harmful use of alcohol by providing guidance to countries on prevention and treatment policies and interventions."
Amyloidosis,"A rare disease that occurs when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in organs and tissues, interfering with their normal function.",It can be a primary condition or secondary to other chronic inflammatory diseases (like rheumatoid arthritis) or cancers (like multiple myeloma). Some types are hereditary.,"Symptoms are diverse and depend on which organs are affected. They can include severe fatigue, weight loss, swelling in the legs, shortness of breath, and numbness in the hands or feet.","For secondary amyloidosis, effective treatment of the underlying inflammatory disease is the best precaution. For hereditary types, genetic counseling may be recommended.","DISCLAIMER: Amyloidosis is a serious, complex disease requiring specialized medical care. Home care is purely supportive. Following a low-salt diet to manage swelling, eating small, frequent meals if appetite is poor, and balancing rest with gentle activity, as advised by a doctor.","Amyloidosis can affect many different organs, including the heart, kidneys, liver, and nerves, and can be life-threatening. Early diagnosis and treatment to stop the production of the amyloid protein are key.","WHO does not have specific guidelines for amyloidosis due to its rarity. It is managed under the umbrella of diseases affecting specific organs (e.g., heart failure, kidney disease) and within hematology/oncology if related to a blood cancer."
Anaemia,"Anaemia is a medical condition where the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells or a reduced amount of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Without enough oxygen, the body cannot function properly.","The most common cause is iron deficiency. Other causes include deficiencies in vitamin B12 or folate, significant blood loss (from injury or heavy menstruation), chronic diseases (like kidney disease or cancer), genetic disorders (such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia), and bone marrow problems.","Fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath","Eat a balanced diet rich in iron, vitamin B12, and folate. Include foods high in Vitamin C (like citrus fruits) to help absorb iron. Avoid drinking tea or coffee with meals, as they can hinder iron absorption. Get regular health check-ups to monitor blood levels, especially for pregnant women and those with chronic conditions.","Avoid drinking tea and coffee immediately after meals as the tannin present in these interferes in the absorption of iron from the food. Take freshly prepared apple juice an hour before meals or just before retiring for the night. For proper absorption of the juice, remember the stomach should be relatively empty when you have the juice and also do not take anything for about half an hour after the juice. Juice of beetroot taken 1-2 times daily is an excellent remedy for anaemia especially for children and teenagers. You may combine apple and beetroot for the juice. Mix 1 tablespoon amla juice with a ripe mashed banana and eat 2-3 times a day. Have a ripe banana with 1 tablespoon honey, 1-2 times a day. Soak 8-10 almonds (badam) and 1 teaspoon rice overnight. Remove outer skin of almonds and grind to a fine paste. Boil with 1Â½ cups of milk and a pinch of turmeric powder (haldi). Sweeten with sugar and drink for a fedays, once a day. Soak 10-12 currants (munakas) in water overnight. Remove seeds and eat them. Have for 2-4 weeks. Have spinach juice of 125 gm spinach everyday, for 2-3 weeks. Foods rich in iron are - honey, almonds, bananas, apricots (khurmani), raisins (kishmish), fenugreek (methi) leaves, fenugreek seeds (methi daana), lettuce or salad leaves, onion, spinach (paalak), grapes, tomatoes, carrots, gooseberry (amla), beetroots (chokunder), apples, pomegranate (anaar). Have plenty of them if you are anaemic.","Anaemia is a major global health concern, particularly affecting women and children. It is not just feeling tired; it can lead to serious health complications if left untreated. Most cases of anaemia are preventable and treatable through proper nutrition and medical care. Always consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment instead of self-medicating with supplements.","WHO identifies anaemia as a serious global public health problem. It aims to reduce the prevalence of anaemia in women of reproductive age by 50%. WHO recommends strategies like dietary diversification, food fortification with iron and folic acid, and daily iron supplementation for pregnant women and adolescent girls in high-prevalence areas. They also emphasize controlling infections that can cause anaemia, such as malaria and worm infestations."
Anal Fissure,"A small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus.","Commonly caused by passing large or hard stools (constipation). It can also be caused by chronic diarrhea, straining during childbirth, or inflammatory bowel disease.","Sharp pain during and after bowel movements, which can last for several hours. Bright red blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet bowl.","The best precaution is to prevent constipation. Eat a high-fiber diet, drink plenty of fluids, and get regular exercise. Avoid straining during bowel movements.",DISCLAIMER: Persistent symptoms should be evaluated by a doctor. These measures help healing and prevent recurrence. Taking warm baths (sitz baths) for 10-20 minutes several times a day to relax the anal sphincter. Applying petroleum jelly to the area. Using over-the-counter stool softeners.,"Most anal fissures heal within a few weeks with home care. However, fissures that do not heal may be considered chronic and require medical treatment, such as prescription creams or surgery.","WHO promotes healthy diets rich in fiber and adequate fluid intake as part of its general recommendations for preventing non-communicable diseases, which also helps prevent conditions like constipation and anal fissures."
Angle-Closure Glaucoma,"A type of glaucoma that occurs when the drainage angle in the eye (where the iris meets the cornea) becomes blocked, preventing aqueous humor from draining. This causes a rapid, severe increase in eye pressure.","Can be triggered by the pupil dilating, which can cause the iris to bunch up and block the drainage angle. People with ""narrow angles"" are anatomically predisposed.","An acute attack causes sudden, severe eye pain, blurred vision, halos around lights, headache, nausea, and vomiting. It is a medical emergency.",People with a family history or those identified as having narrow angles during an eye exam can undergo a preventative laser procedure (iridotomy) to create a small hole in theiris for fluid to drain.,DISCLAIMER: Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency that can cause blindness. Go to an emergency room immediately. There are NO home treatments for an acute attack.,"This condition can cause permanent vision loss very quickly if not treated immediately. It is crucial to recognize the symptoms and seek emergency care. A chronic form also exists, which is often asymptomatic.","WHO's ""World Report on Vision"" aims to increase access to eye care. This includes promoting regular eye exams, which can identify individuals at risk for angle-closure glaucoma before an acute attack occurs, allowing for preventative treatment."
Anorexia Nervosa,"An eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of weight or shape.","A complex combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Genetic predisposition, personality traits like perfectionism, and societal pressure for thinness all play a role.","Extreme weight loss, refusal to eat, intense fear of weight gain, distorted body image, and severe restriction of food intake. Physical symptoms include fatigue, dizziness, and hair loss.","Promoting a healthy body image, building self-esteem, discouraging dieting, and having open family discussions about healthy eating habits can be protective factors.","DISCLAIMER: Anorexia Nervosa is a serious psychiatric illness requiring a multidisciplinary medical team (doctors, therapists, dietitians). Home support is crucial but must be guided by professionals. Encouraging regular meal patterns without pressure, providing emotional support, and participating in family-based therapy.",This disorder has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness due to medical complications from starvation and suicide. Early and intensive treatment provides the best chance for recovery.,WHO recognizes eating disorders as serious mental health conditions. Their Mental Health Action Plan advocates for integrating mental health services into primary care to improve early detection and access to evidence-based treatments.
Antimicrobial Drugs Poisoning,"Harm or toxicity caused by taking an excessive dose of an antimicrobial drug (like an antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal) or by having an adverse reaction to a normal dose.","Can be accidental (e.g., a child ingesting medication) or intentional. It can also occur if kidney or liver function is impaired, preventing the body from clearing the drug normally.","Symptoms vary widely depending on the drug but can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, dizziness, seizures, or damage to the kidneys (nephrotoxicity) or liver (hepatotoxicity).",Store all medications safely out of reach of children. Take medications only as prescribed by your doctor and never exceed the recommended dose. Be aware of potential side effects.,DISCLAIMER: This is a medical emergency. Contact your local poison control center or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not induce vomiting unless instructed to do so. Bring the medication bottle with you.,"The severity of poisoning depends on the drug, the amount taken, and the person's health. Prompt medical intervention is critical to manage the toxicity and prevent permanent organ damage.","WHO's program on the Rational Use of Medicines aims to ensure patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements. This includes preventing overuse and incorrect use that can lead to toxicity. WHO also promotes the strengthening of poison control centers."
Anxiety,"Anxiety is the body's natural response to stress, characterized by feelings of fear or apprehension about what's to come. While occasional anxiety is a normal part of life, anxiety disorders involve excessive and persistent worry that is intense enough to interfere with daily activities. These disorders include conditions like Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder.","The exact causes are a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors. Key contributors include a family history of mental health conditions, imbalances in brain chemistry (neurotransmitters), exposure to stressful or traumatic life events, underlying health issues (like thyroid or heart problems), and substance use or withdrawal.","Excessive worrying, restlessness, increased heart rate, panic attacks","Managing anxiety involves lifestyle changes and proactive care. Regular physical exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep are fundamental. Limiting caffeine and alcohol can also help. Practicing stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness, meditation, and deep breathing can prevent symptoms from escalating. Maintaining strong social connections provides crucial support.","Therapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychotherapy), medications (antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs)","Anxiety disorders are real, common, and treatable medical conditions, not a sign of personal weakness. Openly discussing anxiety helps to reduce stigma and encourages people to seek help. Support from family, friends, and colleagues is vital for recovery. Effective treatments, including psychotherapy (like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT) and medication, are widely available.","The WHO recognizes anxiety disorders as a leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the global burden of disease. It advocates for integrating mental health services into primary healthcare to improve accessibility. The WHO's Mental Health Action Plan promotes mental well-being, prevention of mental disorders, and community-based care. It also emphasizes the effectiveness of scalable psychological interventions that can be delivered by trained non-specialists."
Arthritis,"Arthritis is a general term for conditions that cause inflammation and swelling of one or more joints. There are over 100 different types of arthritis, with the most common being osteoarthritis (OA), which involves wear-and-tear damage to joint cartilage, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the joints. It leads to pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility.","The cause varies by type. Osteoarthritis is primarily caused by mechanical wear and tear on joints over time, with risk factors like age, obesity, and previous injury. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder where genetic and environmental factors trigger the immune system to attack joint tissues. Other types, like gout, are caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in a joint.","Joint pain, stiffness, swelling","exercise,use hot and cold therapy,try acupuncture,massage","Self-care focuses on pain relief and maintaining function. Applying heat (like a warm compress) can ease stiffness, while cold packs can reduce swelling and numb acute pain. Gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises help keep joints flexible. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory creams and assistive devices (like canes or jar openers) can also make daily activities easier. A balanced, anti-inflammatory diet may also help manage symptoms.","Arthritis is a leading cause of disability and is not just a disease of old age; it can affect people of all ages, including children. While there is no cure for most types, effective treatments and management strategies exist that can significantly reduce pain and improve quality of life. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible joint damage. It's an often invisible illness, and the associated fatigue and pain are not always apparent to others.","The WHO classifies asthma as a major noncommunicable disease and the most common chronic disease among children. The organization works to improve global access to diagnosis and treatment. WHO's strategy focuses on strengthening primary health care to manage chronic respiratory diseases and ensuring the availability and affordability of essential asthma medicines, particularly inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Their goal is to reduce the global burden of asthma by preventing deaths and reducing hospital admissions."
Asthma,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects the airways of the lungs. It causes the airways to become inflamed and narrow, leading to the production of extra mucus. This makes it difficult to breathe and can trigger coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The severity of asthma varies from person to person and can range from a minor nuisance to a life-threatening emergency.","The exact cause of asthma is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Asthma symptoms are often triggered by specific substances or situations. Common triggers include airborne allergens like pollen and dust mites, respiratory infections (like the common cold), physical activity, cold air, air pollutants and irritants such as smoke, and certain medications.","Recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing, especially at night or in response to triggers such as allergens or exercise","Effective management involves identifying and avoiding personal triggers. It is crucial to work with a doctor to create an 'Asthma Action Plan' for managing symptoms and responding to attacks. Use prescribed long-term controller medications consistently to reduce airway inflammation, and always carry a quick-relief (rescue) inhaler. Regular check-ups and monitoring lung function with a peak flow meter are also important preventive measures.","Mix 1 teaspoon honey with Â½ teaspoon cinnamon (dalchini) powder and have at night before going to bed. Boil carom seeds (ajwain) in water and inhale the steam. Boil 8-10 flakes of garlic (lasan) in Â½ cup of milk. Have this every night. Gives excellent results in early stages of asthma. Add a handful of drumstick leaves (sahijan) to 1 cup water. Boil. Simmer on loflame for 3-4 minutes. Cool and strain. Add salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste. Have every day, once or twice a day. wAn expectorant and a very effective remedy for asthma is prepared by boiling 6 cloves (laung) in 3 tablespoons of water. Take 1 teaspoon of this decoction with a little honey, thrice daily. Mix Â¼ teaspoon asafetida (hing), 2 teaspoon honey, Â½ teaspoon juice from betel leaf (paan ka patta), Â½ teaspoon white onion juice. Have it 2-3 times a day. To take out juice from betel leaf, Clove flowers crush to a paste and squeeze through a clean muslin cloth. For onion juice, grate the onion and squeeze through a clean muslin cloth. Mix equal amounts of fresh ginger (adrak) juice, honey & pomegranate (anaar) juice. Take 1 tablespoon, 1-2 times a day. Figs (anjeer) are known to give relief by draining the phlegm (balgam). Take 3-4 dry figs, wash them well with warm water. Soak overnight in a cup of water. Eat them first thing in the morning and also drink the water. Do this for at least 2 months.","Asthma is a manageable chronic condition, not a contagious disease. With proper diagnosis and treatment, people with asthma can lead normal, active lives. It is crucial to understand that an asthma attack can be a life-threatening event. Over-reliance on rescue inhalers is a sign that the asthma is not well-controlled and requires a doctor's review. Improving air quality is a key public health goal to reduce the burden of asthma.","The WHO classifies asthma as a major noncommunicable disease and the most common chronic disease among children. The organization works to improve global access to diagnosis and treatment. WHO's strategy focuses on strengthening primary health care to manage chronic respiratory diseases and ensuring the availability and affordability of essential asthma medicines, particularly inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Their goal is to reduce the global burden of asthma by preventing deaths and reducing hospital admissions."
Astigmatism,A common and generally treatable imperfection in the curvature of the eye's cornea or lens. This causes blurred or distorted vision at all distances.,"Caused by an irregularly shaped cornea or lens. Instead of being round like a basketball, the surface is shaped more like a football, causing light to focus on multiple points instead of one.","Blurred or distorted vision, eye strain, headaches, difficulty with night vision, and squinting to see clearly.",Astigmatism cannot be prevented as it's usually present at birth or develops naturally. Regular eye exams are key for early detection and correction.,"DISCLAIMER: Astigmatism requires professional diagnosis and correction. Home measures can only help with symptoms of eye strain. Taking regular breaks from screens (20-20-20 rule), ensuring good lighting for reading, and adjusting screen brightness to comfortable levels.","It is not an eye disease but a refractive error. It's a very common vision problem that can be easily corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery.","WHO's ""World Report on Vision"" highlights uncorrected refractive errors, including astigmatism, as the leading cause of vision impairment globally. They advocate for increased access to eye exams and affordable corrective solutions like eyeglasses."
Atelectasis,"The collapse of a lung or, more commonly, a part (lobe) of a lung. It occurs when the small air sacs (alveoli) within the lung become deflated or fill with fluid.",Most often caused by a blockage in the airways (like a mucus plug or tumor) or by pressure from outside the lung (like from fluid or air). It's a common complication after surgery due to anesthesia and shallow breathing.,"Symptoms depend on the extent of the collapse. Small areas may cause no symptoms. Larger areas can cause shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, chest pain, and coughing.","After surgery, deep breathing exercises, frequent coughing, and changing positions are crucial to keep the lungs expanded. Quitting smoking before surgery significantly reduces risk.","DISCLAIMER: This condition requires medical treatment. These measures are preventative, especially post-surgery, as guided by a healthcare provider. Practicing deep breathing exercises using an incentive spirometer. Getting up and walking as soon as possible after surgery.",Atelectasis can lead to pneumonia if the collapsed lung area becomes infected. Treatment focuses on removing the blockage or pressure and re-expanding the lung tissue.,"WHO promotes post-operative care protocols that include respiratory therapy and early mobilization to prevent complications like atelectasis and pneumonia, contributing to safer surgery outcomes."
Atrophic Vaginitis,"Thinning, drying, and inflammation of the vaginal walls due to your body having less estrogen. It most commonly occurs after menopause.","The primary cause is a decrease in estrogen production. This happens naturally during menopause but can also occur after surgical removal of the ovaries, during breastfeeding, or as a side effect of some medications.","Vaginal dryness, burning, itching, discharge, and pain during intercourse. It can also cause urinary symptoms like urgency and burning with urination.","While the estrogen loss of menopause is not preventable, staying sexually active (with or without a partner) can help maintain vaginal health by increasing blood flow.",DISCLAIMER: Symptoms should be discussed with a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment. Over-the-counter vaginal moisturizers (used regularly) and lubricants (used for intercourse) can provide significant relief from dryness.,"This is a very common and treatable condition. It can significantly impact quality of life and sexual health. Many women are hesitant to discuss it, but effective treatments like low-dose vaginal estrogen are available.",WHO's work on healthy aging for women includes addressing the health challenges of the post-menopausal period. This involves raising awareness and ensuring access to care for conditions like atrophic vaginitis as part of comprehensive primary healthcare.
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),"A chronic condition that affects millions of children and often continues into adulthood. It includes a combination of persistent problems, such as difficulty sustaining attention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior.","The exact cause is not known, but it's a combination of genetics, brain development, and environmental factors. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder.","Inattention (e.g., easily distracted, disorganized), hyperactivity (e.g., fidgeting, unable to stay seated), and impulsivity (e.g., interrupting others, acting without thinking).",ADHD is not preventable. Early diagnosis and management can help improve long-term outcomes and reduce the impact of symptoms.,"DISCLAIMER: ADHD requires a professional diagnosis and a comprehensive treatment plan (therapy, medication). Home strategies support this plan. Creating structure and routine, breaking down large tasks into smaller steps, using timers and reminders, providing positive reinforcement, and ensuring a healthy diet and regular exercise.","ADHD is a real medical condition that can affect school performance, work, and relationships. It is not a result of laziness or lack of discipline. With proper treatment and support, individuals with ADHD can be very successful.","WHO recognizes ADHD as a common and impairing disorder. Their Mental Health Action Plan advocates for scaling up care for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in non-specialized health settings to improve access to diagnosis and evidence-based care."
Autism,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent challenges in social interaction, speech and nonverbal communication, and the presence of restricted or repetitive behaviors. The term 'spectrum' highlights the wide variation in the strengths and challenges among autistic people. It impacts how an individual perceives the world and interacts with others.","The exact cause of ASD is not fully known, but research strongly suggests that it stems from a combination of genetic and environmental influences. A significant genetic component means it often runs in families. Environmental factors, such as advanced parental age or certain prenatal exposures, may also increase risk. It is scientifically proven that vaccines do not cause autism.","Challenges with social interaction, communication difficulties, restricted interests or repetitive behaviors","ASD is not a condition to be prevented, but its challenges can be managed with support. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for positive long-term outcomes. Key management strategies include structured educational programs, behavioral therapies like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), speech therapy to improve communication, and occupational therapy to help with sensory issues and daily living skills. Creating predictable and supportive environments is key.","Home-based support focuses on creating a safe, structured, and understanding environment. This includes establishing consistent daily routines to reduce anxiety, using clear and simple language, and employing visual aids like schedules or charts to help with transitions and understanding. It's also vital to accommodate sensory needs, such as providing a quiet space for retreat or using tools like noise-canceling headphones. Reinforcing positive behaviors and nurturing the individual's unique strengths and interests is fundamental.","Autism is a spectrum, meaning every autistic individual has a unique set of abilities and challenges. It is a lifelong condition, not a disease that can be 'cured.' The goal is to provide support, acceptance, and inclusion. Promoting the concept of neurodiversityâthe idea that neurological differences like autism are a natural part of human variationâhelps combat stigma and fosters a more inclusive society. Many autistic individuals lead independent and fulfilling lives.","The WHO recognizes ASD as a lifelong developmental condition and advocates for the rights of autistic people. It emphasizes that care should focus on offering evidence-based psychosocial interventions that enhance communication and social skills and support well-being. The WHO's Mental Health Action Plan promotes inclusive community-based care and services that are responsive to the needs of individuals with ASD and their families across their entire lifespan, including access to education and employment opportunities."
Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID),"An eating disorder characterized by a persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional needs, leading to significant weight loss, nutritional deficiency, or dependence on supplements, without the distorted body image seen in anorexia.","Can be caused by a lack of interest in eating, avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food (texture, smell), or a conditioned negative response associated with a past traumatic event like choking.","Extreme picky eating, lack of appetite, fear of choking or vomiting, significant weight loss or poor growth in children.","The cause is complex and not fully understood, so prevention is difficult. Creating a positive, low-pressure mealtime environment for children may be helpful.","DISCLAIMER: ARFID requires professional treatment from a multidisciplinary team. Home support is guided by this team. Gradually introducing new foods in a non-threatening way (food chaining), avoiding pressure or force-feeding, and focusing on creating positive experiences around food.","ARFID is more than just ""picky eating."" It can lead to serious medical and nutritional complications. It is a recognized psychiatric disorder that requires specialized therapy to address the underlying fears and behaviors.",WHO's classification of diseases (ICD-11) includes ARFID as a distinct feeding and eating disorder. This recognition helps standardize diagnosis and encourages research and development of effective treatments.
Baldness,"Baldness, medically known as androgenetic alopecia, is the most common type of hair loss, affecting both men (male-pattern baldness) and women (female-pattern hair loss). It is a progressive condition characterized by the shrinking of hair follicles on the scalp, which leads to shorter, finer hairs and eventually stops new hair growth in affected areas. While it is not a physically harmful condition, it can significantly impact a person's self-esteem and confidence.","The primary cause is a combination of genetics and hormones. A hereditary sensitivity to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a byproduct of testosterone, causes hair follicles to miniaturize. The likelihood and pattern of baldness are largely inherited. Ageing is also a major factor, as hair growth naturally slows over time. Other causes of hair loss can include certain medical conditions, severe stress, nutritional deficiencies, and medications.","In men, the typical pattern begins with a receding hairline and thinning at the crown of the head, which can eventually merge. In women, it usually presents as a general thinning of hair across the entire scalp, most noticeably at the part line, without a significantly receding hairline. An early symptom for both is an increased amount of hair shedding.","While genetic baldness cannot be entirely prevented, its progression can often be slowed. Medically proven treatments like topical Minoxidil and oral Finasteride (for men) are effective. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in iron, zinc, and protein is crucial for hair health. Gentle hair care practices, such as avoiding tight hairstyles that pull on the roots (traction alopecia) and minimizing harsh chemical treatments, can also help preserve hair.","Boil 1 cup mustard oil (sarson ka tel) with 4 tablespoon henna (mehendi) leaves. Filter and bottle. Massage on the bald patches regularly. Grind the remains of tobacco smoked in a hookah and add to boiling mustard oil. Cool and store. Massage on the bald patches regularly. Rub on the scalp 1 teaspoon oil in which raw mangoes have been preserved for over one year. Repeat this treatment frequently. Grind 1 tablespoon liquorice root pieces (mulathi) in 1 cup milk with Â¼ teaspoon saffron (kesar). Apply this paste on bald patches at bedtime continuously. Grind fenugreek seeds (methi dana), with water and apply on the head. Leave for at least 40 minutes before washing. Do it every morning for a month. Bed sores w Apply honey on the length and breadth of a banana leaf and lie on it for a few hours. Ensure its contact with the affected parts.","Baldness is an extremely common condition, not a disease. It affects the majority of men and a significant number of women during their lifetime. It's important to approach the topic with sensitivity, as it can cause considerable psychological distress. People should be cautious of unproven 'miracle cures' and consult a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and information on scientifically-backed treatments. Accepting baldness is also a valid personal choice.","The World Health Organization (WHO) does not issue specific guidelines for androgenetic alopecia as it is a cosmetic and non-life-threatening condition. However, it is classified as a dermatological disorder. WHO's general principles support access to safe and effective medical care for conditions that impact an individual's quality of life and mental well-being. They would recommend consulting a healthcare professional to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any underlying medical causes for hair loss that may require specific treatment."
Benzodiazepine Use Disorder,"A substance use disorder characterized by the compulsive, prolonged use of benzodiazepine medications (e.g., Xanax, Valium, Ativan) despite harmful consequences.",Develops from the misuse of prescribed medications or illicit use. These drugs have a high potential for tolerance (needing more for the same effect) and physical dependence.,"Craving the medication, being unable to cut down on use, continuing use despite negative impacts on work or relationships, and experiencing withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, seizures) when trying to stop.","Use benzodiazepines only as prescribed, for the shortest duration possible. Never take someone else's prescription. Be aware of the potential for dependence.",DISCLAIMER: Abruptly stopping benzodiazepines can be dangerous and even life-threatening due to the risk of seizures. Medical supervision is required for detoxification. There are no safe home treatments for withdrawal.,"This is a serious disorder that requires medical help. A supervised, gradual tapering of the dose is the standard method for safely discontinuing the drug, often accompanied by therapy.","WHO addresses substance use disorders as a major public health priority. Their guidelines emphasize prevention, treatment, and care, including managing withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics like benzodiazepines and promoting alternatives for managing anxiety and insomnia."
Binge Eating Disorder,A serious eating disorder in which you frequently consume unusually large amounts of food and feel unable to stop eating. It is the most common eating disorder in the United States.,"A complex mix of genetic, biological, and psychological factors. It's associated with dieting history, depression, anxiety, and coping difficulties. It is not about a lack of willpower.","Recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food in a short time, feeling a loss of control during the binge, eating until uncomfortably full, eating alone due to embarrassment, and feeling disgusted or guilty afterward.","Promoting a healthy relationship with food and a positive body image, avoiding restrictive dieting, and developing healthy coping mechanisms for stress and emotional distress.","DISCLAIMER: This disorder requires professional therapy (like CBT) and sometimes medication. Home support can include practicing mindfulness, keeping a food and mood journal, planning regular, balanced meals to avoid extreme hunger, and finding non-food-related ways to cope with emotions.","Binge eating disorder is a treatable condition. Unlike bulimia, individuals do not regularly use compensatory measures (like purging) to counter the binge eating. It is strongly associated with obesity and related health problems.","WHO's Mental Health Action Plan aims to improve access to evidence-based care for mental disorders, including eating disorders. They promote psychological interventions as effective treatments."
Bipolar Disorder,"Bipolar Disorder is a chronic mental health condition characterized by significant, often extreme, shifts in a person's mood, energy, activity levels, and ability to function. These shifts occur in distinct periods called mood episodes: **Manic Episodes** (unusually elevated, irritable, or 'high' mood with increased energy) and **Major Depressive Episodes** (sadness, hopelessness, or indifference with very low energy). Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition that requires continuous treatment.","The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of factors: **Genetics** (it often runs in families, suggesting a hereditary link), **biological factors** (differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function), and **environmental/psychological factors** (stressful life events, trauma, substance misuse, or a serious illness can trigger or exacerbate episodes).","Mood swings, manic episodes, depressive episode","Adhere strictly to the prescribed treatment plan (medication and therapy). **Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs**, as they can trigger or worsen symptoms. **Maintain a consistent routine** for sleeping, eating, and exercising, as sleep disruption is a common trigger for manic episodes. Learn to recognize the early **warning signs** of an oncoming manic or depressive episode, and alert your support system or care team immediately.","Bipolar disorder cannot be treated with home remedies alone; it requires professional medical and psychiatric care. However, self-management strategies are vital: **Keep a mood journal/life chart** to track mood swings, sleep patterns, and potential triggers. **Engage in regular exercise** (like jogging or walking). **Prioritize a consistent sleep schedule** (go to bed and wake up at the same time). **Minimize stress** through relaxation techniques (like meditation or yoga). **Build a strong support network** of family and friends.","Bipolar disorder is a serious illness associated with a high risk of suicide, job loss, and difficulty functioning. It does not go away on its own and requires lifelong, continuous treatment. There are different types (Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Cyclothymia), and misdiagnosis is common, as depressive symptoms can be confused with major depression. Early, accurate diagnosis and consistent treatment (medication, psychotherapy) are essential for achieving stability and a better quality of life.","The WHO recognizes Bipolar Disorder as a leading cause of global disability. It recommends a treatment approach combining **medicines** (mood stabilizers and antipsychotics) with **psychological and psychosocial interventions** (e.g., Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Interpersonal Therapy, psychoeducation). WHO emphasizes the need for **long-term, continuous care**, reducing stigma and discrimination, and ensuring people with the disorder are meaningfully involved in their treatment choices."
Blackheads,"Blackheads, medically known as open comedones, are a mild form of acne. They are small bumps that appear on the skin due to clogged hair follicles. Each follicle contains a hair and a sebaceous gland that produces oil (sebum). When dead skin cells and excess sebum collect and plug the follicle opening, a bump forms. If the skin over the bump opens, exposure to air causes the trapped material to oxidize and turn black, forming a blackhead.","The primary causes include the overproduction of sebum by the skin's oil glands, often triggered by hormonal fluctuations during puberty, menstruation, or pregnancy. An irregular shedding of dead skin cells leads to them mixing with sebum and clogging the pore. The presence of acne-causing bacteria on the skin and using oily or pore-clogging (comedogenic) skincare products can also contribute.","The main symptom is the appearance of small, dark or black-colored spots on the skin's surface. Unlike pimples, blackheads are not inflamed, so they are not typically painful or red. They are flat against the skin and most commonly found on the face, particularly the nose, chin, and forehead, but can also appear on the back, chest, and shoulders.","Prevention focuses on a consistent skincare routine. Wash your face twice daily with a gentle cleanser to remove excess oil. Regularly use products with exfoliants like salicylic acid, which helps dissolve the contents of a clog. Always choose skincare and makeup products that are labeled 'non-comedogenic' or 'oil-free' to avoid clogging pores. Avoid touching your face frequently to prevent the transfer of dirt and oils.",Mix 1 teaspoon lime juice in 1 teaspoon finely ground cinnamon (dalchini) powder and apply on affected areas frequently. Mix 1 teaspoon each turmeric (haldi) powder and juice of fresh coriander (dhania) leaves and apply daily as a face pack before going to sleep.,"It is a common myth that blackheads are dirt trapped in pores. The dark color is simply oxidized sebum and skin cells. Over-scrubbing the skin can cause irritation and make the problem worse. Blackheads are a very common skin issue, not a sign of poor hygiene. Patience and consistent use of the right products are key to managing them effectively.","The World Health Organization (WHO) does not provide specific guidelines for minor dermatological conditions like blackheads. However, general public health guidance promotes good personal hygiene and skin care as part of overall health and well-being. Health organizations would recognize acne (including blackheads) as a condition that, while not life-threatening, can cause significant psychological distress and recommend consulting a dermatologist for persistent or severe cases to prevent scarring and improve quality of life."
Bladder Cancer,"Cancer that begins in the cells of the bladder, a hollow, muscular organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine.","The most significant cause is smoking. Exposure to certain industrial chemicals (e.g., in the dye, rubber, and leather industries) is another major risk factor. Chronic bladder inflammation and infections can also increase risk.","Blood in the urine (hematuria) is the most common sign. Other symptoms include frequent urination, painful urination, and back pain.","The most important precaution is to not smoke, or to quit smoking. If working with industrial chemicals, follow all safety procedures to limit exposure. Drink plenty of fluids.",DISCLAIMER: Cancer requires professional medical treatment. There are NO effective home treatments. Supportive care during treatment can include drinking plenty of water to help flush the bladder (as advised by your doctor) and managing treatment side effects.,"Early-stage bladder cancer is highly treatable. However, it has a high rate of recurrence, so a long-term surveillance schedule with a urologist is essential after initial treatment.","WHO identifies tobacco use as the single most important risk factor for bladder cancer. Their tobacco control initiatives, such as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), are a primary strategy for preventing this and many other cancers."
Bladder Disorder,"A broad term for a range of conditions that affect the bladder's ability to store or empty urine correctly. Examples include urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, and interstitial cystitis.","Causes vary widely and include nerve damage (from diabetes, stroke, or spinal cord injury), weakened pelvic floor muscles (from childbirth or aging), infections, and bladder inflammation.","Symptoms can include urinary leakage (incontinence), a sudden, strong urge to urinate (urgency), frequent urination, and pain in the bladder or pelvic region.","Maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding bladder irritants like caffeine and alcohol, practicing pelvic floor (Kegel) exercises, and not smoking can help prevent or manage some bladder disorders.","DISCLAIMER: Symptoms should be evaluated by a doctor to get a correct diagnosis. For incontinence, bladder training (urinating on a schedule) and pelvic floor exercises can be effective. For irritation, dietary changes can help.","Bladder disorders are common and can significantly affect quality of life. Many people are embarrassed to seek help, but effective treatments are available, ranging from lifestyle changes to medication and surgery.","WHO's programs on healthy aging and management of non-communicable diseases (like neurological conditions) indirectly address bladder disorders, as they are common consequences of other health issues. They support access to continence care as part of comprehensive healthcare."
Body Heat,"Excessive body heat, or heat stress, is a condition where the body absorbs or generates more heat than it can dissipate, causing the core body temperature to rise. The body's natural cooling mechanism, primarily sweating, becomes overwhelmed. This can lead to a spectrum of heat-related illnesses, from mild heat cramps to more severe conditions like heat exhaustion and the life-threatening emergency, heatstroke.","Primary causes include exposure to high environmental temperatures and humidity, strenuous physical exercise, and dehydration. Other contributing factors are wearing tight or non-breathable clothing, consuming spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol which increase metabolism, and certain medical conditions like fever or hyperthyroidism.","Initial symptoms include heavy sweating, feeling faint or dizzy, headache, nausea, and muscle cramps. As the condition worsens into heat exhaustion, the skin may become cool and clammy with a rapid, weak pulse. In the case of a heatstroke (a medical emergency), the person may become confused, have hot, red, dry skin, and lose consciousness.","Prevention is key. Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water and electrolyte-rich fluids throughout the day. Wear loose-fitting, lightweight, and light-colored clothing made from breathable fabrics like cotton. Avoid strenuous outdoor activities during the hottest part of the day, typically between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Seek shade or stay in air-conditioned environments whenever possible.",Add 2 to 3 drops of almonds oil to pomegranate (anaar) juice and drink. Soak 8 to 10 almonds and 1 teaspoon rice overnight. Remove the outer skin. Grind into a fine paste. Mix with some milk and add a pinch of turmeric powder (haldi) and sugar candy (mishri) to taste. Boil and drink. Remove seeds from fresh amla fruits and grind the pulp into a fine paste. Tie it in a muslin cloth and squeeze out the juice. Take 2 teaspoon of this juice and mix it with two teaspoonfuls each honey and lime juice. Add 1 cup water and drink on an empty stomach every morning. Take a tender bel fruit. Grind it with 1 cup milk. Apply on the head and massage well before taking a shower.,"Recognizing the signs of heat-related illnesses is crucial. While mild body heat can be managed at home, conditions like heat exhaustion require immediate attention to prevent progression to heatstroke. Heatstroke is a life-threatening emergency characterized by a high body temperature (above 103Â°F or 40Â°C), confusion, and often a lack of sweating; it requires immediate emergency medical services. Infants, the elderly, and individuals with chronic diseases are particularly vulnerable.","The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies extreme heat as a serious and growing public health risk, especially in the context of climate change. WHO provides guidance for the public during heatwaves, emphasizing the importance of keeping cool, staying hydrated, and checking on vulnerable family and community members. They also assist countries in developing 'Heat-Health Action Plans' to prepare for heat events, improve health system responses, and protect at-risk populations."
Body Pain,"Body pain, or myalgia, is a broad term for aches, soreness, stiffness, or pain in the muscles, joints, or bones throughout the body. It can be **Acute** (sudden and short-lived, usually a response to injury or illness) or **Chronic** (persisting for more than 3 months, often due to an underlying condition). General body aches are frequently a sign that the immune system is fighting an infection or that the body is under physical or emotional stress.""","Causes range from temporary issues to chronic diseases:\n- **Infections/Illnesses:** Common cold, flu, COVID-19, or other viral/bacterial infections (the immune response causes inflammation and aches).\n- **Physical:** Overexertion, muscle strain/overuse, injury, poor posture, or lack of exercise.\n- **Lifestyle:** Dehydration, lack of sleep, high stress, or anxiety.\n- **Chronic Conditions:** Autoimmune diseases (e.g., Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus), Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), or Hypothyroidism.\n- **Deficiencies:** Low levels of certain nutrients like Vitamin D or Potassium (Hypokalemia).\n- **Medications:** Side effects from certain drugs (e.g., statins).","Aching, soreness, stiffness, or throbbing pain that is widespread across the body (not localized to one injury). Often accompanied by:\n- **With Illness:** Fever, chills, fatigue, weakness, headache, sore throat.\n- **With Chronic Pain:** Fatigue, insomnia, mood changes (anxiety/depression), difficulty concentrating, or stiffness.","Maintain a **healthy weight** and **balanced diet**. **Stay hydrated** by drinking plenty of water and non-alcoholic fluids. Get **adequate sleep** (7+ hours for adults). Manage stress through **relaxation techniques** (meditation, deep breathing). Engage in **regular, gentle physical activity** to keep muscles and joints mobile and reduce stiffness. Practice **good posture** when sitting or standing, and lift heavy objects properly (bend with the knees, not the back).",Boil 3 tablespoon powdered nutmeg (jaiphal) in 1 cup sesame oil (til ka tel). Cool and apply on affected parts.,"Acute body aches from a virus usually resolve in a few days. However, **persistent pain** (lasting more than a week or two), pain that is **severe and debilitating**, or pain accompanied by **serious symptoms** (e.g., high fever, stiff neck, confusion, trouble breathing, unexplained weight loss) must be evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out or treat an underlying serious condition. Chronic pain often requires a personalized, multi-faceted approach involving medication, physical therapy, and psychological techniques (like CBT) to manage symptoms and improve daily function.","The WHO emphasizes the burden of **chronic pain** globally and recommends a biopsychosocial model for management. Guidelines highlight the need for **early intervention** to prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain. They encourage strategies that include: patient education, self-management skills, lifestyle adjustments (exercise, diet), addressing psychological factors (anxiety, depression), and using pain relief medications judiciously, with a focus on improving the individual's overall function and quality of life."
Body Swelling,"Body swelling, known medically as edema, is the accumulation of excess fluid in the body's tissues, causing them to puff up. It can affect any part of the body but is most commonly noticed in the hands, feet, ankles, and legs (peripheral edema). Edema is not a disease itself, but rather a symptom of an underlying issue, which can range from temporary and harmless to a sign of a serious medical condition.","Common causes include sitting or standing in one position for too long, high dietary salt intake, pregnancy, and premenstrual hormonal changes. It can also be a side effect of certain medications (like those for high blood pressure). More serious causes include congestive heart failure, kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, venous insufficiency (weak veins in the legs), and problems with the lymphatic system (lymphedema).","The main symptom is noticeable swelling or puffiness of the tissue directly under the skin. The skin over the swollen area might look stretched and shiny. A common sign is 'pitting edema,' where a dimple or indentation remains for a few seconds after you press on the skin. Other symptoms can include a feeling of heaviness, tight-fitting clothes or jewelry, and reduced flexibility in the joints.","For lifestyle-related swelling, prevention involves reducing your salt consumption to minimize fluid retention. Avoid sitting or standing for prolonged periods without taking breaks to move around. Regular exercise, particularly activities like walking, helps improve circulation and pump excess fluid from your limbs back towards the heart. Maintaining a healthy weight also reduces strain on your circulatory system.","Grind black cumin seeds (shah jeera) with a little hot water and apply on affected parts. Body weak ness w Soak 8 to 10 almonds and 1 teaspoon rice overnight. Remove the outer skin of almonds. Grind into a fine paste. Mix in some milk and a pinch of turmeric powder (haldi).

Sprinkle the following on a platter of mango slices : 1 teaspoon honey, a pinch of saffron (kesar), cardamom (chhoti illaichi) and rose water (gulab jal). Take twice daily.","While some swelling is common and benign, it should never be ignored if it is sudden, severe, or persistent. Swelling in just one leg, especially if accompanied by pain, could indicate a blood clot (Deep Vein Thrombosis) and is a medical emergency. Swelling accompanied by shortness of breath or chest pain is also an emergency and could signal a heart problem. Always consult a healthcare professional for unexplained edema.","The World Health Organization (WHO) does not have specific guidelines for the symptom of edema. Instead, its focus is on the prevention and management of the major Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) that are often the root cause, such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, and liver disease. WHO's global strategies emphasize early diagnosis, lifestyle modifications (like salt reduction), and effective management of these chronic conditions to prevent severe complications, of which edema is a significant warning sign."
Boils,"A boil (furuncle) is a painful, pus-filled skin infection that forms when bacteria infect and inflame one or more hair follicles. A carbuncle is a cluster of boils that form a connected, deeper area of infection. They usually start as small, red, tender bumps and grow larger as pus collects. Boils are common, typically resolve with home care, but severe cases or carbuncles may require medical intervention and antibiotics.","Boils are typically caused by the bacteria **Staphylococcus aureus** ('staph'), which commonly lives harmlessly on the skin or in the nose. Infection occurs when the bacteria enter a hair follicle, often due to a break in the skin (like a small scratch, insect bite, or friction). Risk factors include: **diabetes**, having other **skin conditions** (like acne or eczema), a **weakened immune system**, and close contact with someone who has a staph infection.","A red, tender bump that is initially small (pea-sized) but can enlarge significantly. The lump becomes **painful** and fills with **pus**. The skin around the bump may be red, swollen, and warm. A boil may develop a yellow-white tip (head) that eventually **ruptures and drains** pus. Carbuncles are larger, deeper, and often accompanied by systemic symptoms like **fever and chills**.","Maintain **excellent personal hygiene**: Wash hands frequently with soap, and bathe or shower regularly. Keep cuts, scratches, and abrasions clean and covered with sterile bandages until healed. **Do not scratch scabs** or existing boils. **Avoid sharing** personal items like towels, washcloths, razors, or clothing. Wash bedding and towels at a high temperature, especially if you have an active boil.","Slightly roast a big onion on a naked flame. Mash it and mix in teaspoon each turmeric powder and ghee. Apply and tie a bandage. Mash the garlic (lasan) cloves and apply externally. Ground neem leaves into a paste and apply on affected parts. Apply a paste of ginger (adrak) powder and turmeric (haldi) (1:1) on boils. Grind some black cumin (kala jeera) seeds in a little water and apply the paste on the affected areas. Heat black pepper powder in Â½ teaspoon ghee until charred. Use this as an ointment. Take fenugreek leaf (methi patta) paste, heat it and when lukewarm, apply on the affected parts of the body. Soak bread in warm milk and sandwich the mixture in-between the folds of a clean cotton cloth. Apply this poultice to the boil and hold in place with a cotton bandage. This draws the dirt to the surface of the skin and simultaneously bursts the boil.","Boils are infectious and can spread to other parts of the body or to other people. **Seek medical attention** if a boil is on the **face, spine, or near the eye** (due to risk of infection spreading to the brain), is **extremely painful**, rapidly worsening, has not healed in two weeks, recurs frequently, or is accompanied by a **fever** or signs of spreading infection (e.g., red streaks from the boil). Carbuncles almost always require a doctor's care (incision and drainage, plus antibiotics).","The WHO focuses on hygiene practices as a cornerstone of preventing bacterial skin infections. They recommend **thorough hand hygiene** and proper wound care to prevent the entry of common bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus. For confirmed bacterial skin infections, WHO guidelines stress the importance of appropriate diagnosis and the judicious use of **antibiotics** to combat the infection while minimizing the risk of antimicrobial resistance."
Bone Cancer,"Bone cancer is a rare type of malignancy that originates in the cells of a bone. It is crucial to distinguish it from secondary (metastatic) bone cancer, which starts in another organ and spreads to the bones. Primary bone cancer most commonly affects the long bones of the arms and legs, and the pelvis. The main types include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma, each affecting different bone cells and age groups.","The exact cause of most primary bone cancers is unknown. However, a small percentage of cases are linked to specific risk factors. These include certain rare genetic syndromes (like Li-Fraumeni syndrome), previous exposure to high doses of radiation therapy for other cancers, and pre-existing benign bone conditions such as Paget's disease of bone. Bone cancer is not caused by injuries or lifestyle choices.","Bone pain, fractures, fatigue, unexplained weight loss","There are no known ways to prevent primary bone cancer. Therefore, the focus is on early detection. Key risk factors include a history of radiation therapy or certain genetic conditions. It is critical that any persistent, unexplained bone pain, especially in children and adolescents, is evaluated by a doctor and not dismissed as simple 'growing pains' or a sports injury.","Bone cancer cannot be treated at home and requires immediate, specialized medical care from oncologists. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. 'Home treatment' is purely supportive and aims to manage symptoms and side effects during professional medical care. This includes strict adherence to prescribed pain medication, maintaining good nutrition to support strength, providing emotional support, and using mobility aids to prevent falls or fractures.","Primary bone cancer is rare, with some types being more common in children and young adults. Early and accurate diagnosis at a specialized cancer center is critical for improving survival rates. It is important to differentiate it from metastatic bone cancer, which is far more common. Public awareness should focus on the importance of taking persistent bone pain seriously and seeking timely medical evaluation.","The World Health Organization (WHO) includes bone cancer within its global cancer control initiatives. WHO emphasizes the necessity of early diagnosis, access to multidisciplinary treatment teams (including surgeons, oncologists, and pathologists), and the availability of essential medicines like chemotherapy drugs. Their strategy aims to strengthen health systems to provide comprehensive cancer care, from diagnosis to treatment and palliative care, which is crucial for managing pain and symptoms, particularly in advanced stages of the disease."
Bone Spur of the Calcaneus,"Also known as a heel spur, this is a calcium deposit causing a bony protrusion on the underside of the heel bone (calcaneus).","Heel spurs are caused by long-term muscle and ligament strain on the foot. This strain stretches the plantar fascia and can tear the membrane covering the heel bone, leading to the bony growth. It's often associated with plantar fasciitis.","Often, heel spurs cause no symptoms. When they do, the pain is typically sharp, like a knife in the heel, especially with the first steps in the morning. This pain is often from the associated plantar fasciitis, not the spur itself.","Wear well-fitting, supportive shoes with good shock absorption. Maintain a healthy weight to reduce stress on the feet. Stretch your calves and feet regularly, especially before exercise.","DISCLAIMER: Persistent foot pain requires a medical diagnosis. Home treatments focus on relieving the associated inflammation. Resting the foot, applying ice to the heel for 15 minutes a few times a day, wearing supportive footwear or orthotic inserts, and performing stretching exercises.",The bone spur itself is rarely the cause of pain. Treatment is directed at the soft-tissue inflammation (plantar fasciitis) that accompanies it. Surgery to remove the spur is rarely needed.,WHO's guidance on musculoskeletal health and healthy aging promotes physical activity while also emphasizing the importance of proper footwear and technique to prevent strain injuries.
Brain Abscess,"A collection of pus, enclosed in a capsule, within the brain tissue. It is a rare but life-threatening condition.","Caused by a bacterial or fungal infection that reaches the brain, either from a nearby site (like a severe ear or sinus infection), through the bloodstream from an infection elsewhere, or from a head injury or surgery that introduces germs.","Symptoms can develop slowly and include a severe headache, fever, confusion, seizures, nausea, vomiting, and neurological problems like muscle weakness or difficulty speaking, depending on the abscess's location.","Promptly treating infections, especially those of the sinuses, ears, and teeth, is the most important precaution to prevent the infection from spreading to the brain.","DISCLAIMER: A brain abscess is a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization, antibiotics, and often surgery. There are NO home treatments. Seek emergency medical care at the first sign of symptoms.",This is a very serious condition with a high risk of permanent brain damage or death if not treated quickly and aggressively with intravenous antibiotics and/or surgical drainage.,"WHO provides guidelines for the management of the primary infections (e.g., otitis media, sinusitis) that can lead to a brain abscess. They also have guidelines on the appropriate use of antibiotics to treat severe bacterial infections."
Brain Tumor,A mass or growth of abnormal cells in the brain. Brain tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).,The exact cause of most primary brain tumors is unknown. Some are linked to genetic syndromes or exposure to ionizing radiation. Metastatic brain tumors are caused by cancer that has spread from another part of the body.,"Symptoms vary greatly depending on the tumor's size, location, and growth rate. Common symptoms include new or changing headaches, seizures, personality changes, and problems with vision, speech, or balance.",There are no known ways to prevent most primary brain tumors. Avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure is one of the few known preventative measures.,"DISCLAIMER: A brain tumor requires specialized medical care from a team of experts. There are NO effective home treatments. Home care focuses on safety (e.g., seizure precautions) and managing symptoms and treatment side effects as directed by the medical team.","The distinction between benign and malignant can be blurred in the brain, as even a benign tumor can cause serious problems by pressing on critical brain areas. Treatment depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor.","WHO, through IARC, classifies brain tumors, which is essential for standardizing diagnosis and treatment research globally. They also work to improve access to cancer care, including radiotherapy and neurosurgery, in all countries."
Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is a disease where abnormal breast cells grow out of control, forming tumors that can, if unchecked, spread throughout the body. The cancer cells typically begin in the milk ducts or lobules of the breast. It is the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer deaths among women, but men can also develop it. Early detection significantly increases the chance of successful treatment.","The exact cause is unknown, but certain risk factors increase the likelihood of developing it. These include: **Increasing age**, **family history** (especially in a first-degree relative), **inherited gene mutations** (like BRCA1 and BRCA2), **obesity/overweight**, **harmful use of alcohol**, **tobacco use/smoking**, long-term use of combined **postmenopausal hormone therapy**, early start of menstrual periods (before age 12), and late menopause (after age 55).","Breast lump, changes in breast size or shape, nipple changes, breast pain","While some risk factors are unavoidable, you can lower your risk by: **Maintaining a healthy weight**. **Being physically active** regularly. **Limiting or avoiding alcohol** (safest not to drink). **Quitting smoking**. **Breastfeeding** (if possible, as it is a protective factor). **Limiting combined hormone therapy** after menopause. For high-risk individuals (e.g., strong family history/gene mutations), preventive medications (like Tamoxifen or Raloxifene) or risk-reducing surgery may be discussed with a doctor.","Breast cancer requires professional medical treatment (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormonal/targeted therapy). **Home remedies do not treat breast cancer.** Self-care during diagnosis and treatment includes: **Getting enough rest**, **eating a healthy diet** (rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains), **managing stress**, and **finding support** (support groups, family).","The key to survival is **early detection**. Get used to the normal look and feel of your breasts and **check any new or unusual change** with a healthcare provider immediately, without waiting for the next screening appointment. **Regular screening mammography** (starting at age 40 for most women) is recommended to find cancer before symptoms even appear, when it is most treatable. Most breast lumps are benign, but all should be medically evaluated.","The WHO's Global Breast Cancer Initiative focuses on improving survival rates globally. Key guidelines emphasize: **Health promotion** (reducing risk factors like alcohol and obesity). **Early diagnosis** (raising awareness of signs/symptoms, and implementing screening programs like mammography). **Comprehensive management** (timely access to surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies like chemotherapy and hormonal treatment). The goal is to detect cancer when it is small and localized for the best possible outcome."

Bronchitis,"Inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. It can be acute (short-term) or chronic.","Acute bronchitis is most often caused by a viral infection, typically the same viruses that cause colds and the flu. Chronic bronchitis is most commonly caused by cigarette smoking.","A persistent cough, which may produce mucus. Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include chest discomfort, fatigue, and mild fever. Chronic bronchitis involves a productive cough for at least three months a year for two consecutive years.","To prevent acute bronchitis, practice good hygiene and avoid lung irritants. The most important precaution for preventing chronic bronchitis is to not smoke or quit smoking.","DISCLAIMER: See a doctor if your cough is severe, lasts more than 3 weeks, or you have a high fever. For acute bronchitis, get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids to thin mucus, use a humidifier or inhale steam, and take honey for the cough.","Acute bronchitis usually resolves on its own within a couple of weeks, though the cough can linger. Chronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term condition and a form of COPD.","WHO strongly focuses on tobacco control as the primary means to prevent chronic bronchitis and COPD. For acute respiratory infections, they promote hygiene and vaccination."
Bronchopneumonia,A type of pneumonia that causes inflammation in the alveoli (air sacs) and involves inflammation in the bronchioles (small airways). It often affects the lungs in a patchy pattern.,"Caused by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. It's common for bacteria that normally live in the upper respiratory tract to spread to the lungs, especially in people with weakened immune systems, the very young, or the elderly.","Cough (often with greenish or yellow mucus), fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. Symptoms can develop more gradually than in other types of pneumonia.","Get vaccinated against the flu and pneumococcal disease. Practice good hygiene, including frequent handwashing. Don't smoke.

Go to the nearest emergency room immediately. There are NO home treatments. Treatment in the hospital may involve activated charcoal and supportive care.,"This can be a life-threatening condition. The therapeutic range for this drug is narrow, meaning the difference between an effective dose and a toxic dose is small. Regular blood monitoring is often required.","WHO's program on the Rational Use of Medicines emphasizes safe prescribing practices, including patient education and monitoring for adverse effects of drugs with a narrow therapeutic index like carbamazepine."
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,"Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning is a life-threatening emergency that occurs when carbon monoxide gas is inhaled. CO is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that, when breathed in, displaces oxygen in the blood. This deprives the heart, brain, and other vital organs of oxygen, leading to serious tissue damage and potentially death. It is often called the 'silent killer' because it is undetectable by human senses.","CO poisoning is caused by inhaling combustion fumes from the incomplete burning of fuels. Common sources include faulty or poorly ventilated fuel-burning appliances like furnaces, water heaters, gas stoves, and space heaters. Other major causes are running a car or generator in an enclosed or attached space (like a garage), blocked chimneys or flues, and using charcoal grills or portable camping stoves indoors.","The symptoms of CO poisoning are often mistaken for the flu. Initial signs include a dull headache, weakness, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, shortness of breath, and confusion. As the poisoning worsens, symptoms can escalate to blurred vision, loss of coordination, loss of consciousness, and seizures. A classic but late sign is bright cherry-red skin and lips.","Prevention is the most critical step. Install carbon monoxide detectors on every level of your home, especially near sleeping areas, and test them regularly. Have all fuel-burning appliances (furnaces, water heaters, fireplaces) professionally inspected and serviced annually. Ensure proper ventilation for all appliances and never use generators, charcoal grills, or gas-powered tools indoors or in attached garages. Never leave a car running in an enclosed space.","There is NO home treatment for CO poisoning. It is a medical emergency requiring immediate action. If you suspect CO poisoning, immediately move the person to fresh air outdoors and call for emergency medical services right away. Do not attempt to re-enter the area until it has been cleared by emergency responders. Medical treatment typically involves breathing pure oxygen through a mask or, in severe cases, treatment in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.","The primary awareness message is that carbon monoxide is an invisible, silent threat. Because its early symptoms mimic common illnesses, it can be easily overlooked until it's too late. The single most important safety device to protect against CO poisoning is a functional carbon monoxide detector. Everyone should know the sources of CO and the symptoms of poisoning to protect themselves and their families.",The World Health Organization (WHO) addresses carbon monoxide poisoning as part of its broader work on air pollution and household energy. WHO highlights the significant health risks from indoor air pollution caused by inefficient and poorly ventilated cooking and heating with solid fuels and kerosene. Their guidelines promote the adoption of cleaner and safer household energy technologies and fuels to reduce exposure to harmful pollutants like CO. They emphasize public health campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of indoor combustion and the importance of proper ventilation.
Carcinoid Tumor,"A rare, slow-growing type of neuroendocrine tumor that can arise in several places throughout the body, most commonly in the gastrointestinal tract (like the appendix or small intestine) or the lungs.","The exact cause is unknown. They arise from neuroendocrine cells, which have traits of both nerve cells and hormone-producing endocrine cells. Most cases are sporadic, with no clear risk factors.","Many carcinoid tumors cause no symptoms and are found incidentally. When symptoms occur, they can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, or wheezing. Some tumors produce hormones that cause ""carcinoid syndrome"" (flushing, diarrhea).",There are no known ways to prevent carcinoid tumors.,"DISCLAIMER: This is a type of cancer that requires specialized medical treatment. There are NO effective home treatments. Home care focuses on managing symptoms, such as dietary changes to manage diarrhea (avoiding trigger foods like spicy foods and alcohol), as guided by a doctor.","Because they are slow-growing, the prognosis is often good, especially if the tumor is found early and can be removed surgically. However, they can spread to other parts of the body, particularly the liver.","WHO, through IARC, classifies all tumors, including rare neuroendocrine types like carcinoid tumors. This classification is vital for research, accurate diagnosis, and the development of targeted therapies."
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"A common condition that causes pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and arm. It occurs when the median nerve, one of the major nerves to the hand, is squeezed or compressed as it travels through the wrist.","The compression is caused by swelling of the tissues surrounding the flexor tendons in the carpal tunnel. Contributing factors include repetitive hand motions, wrist injuries, and medical conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes.","Numbness or tingling in the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers, which is often worse at night. Weakness in the hand and a tendency to drop objects.",Take frequent breaks from repetitive tasks. Improve your posture and wrist position (keep wrists straight). Use ergonomic keyboards and tools.

Treatment ranges from splinting and steroid injections to surgery.,WHO addresses musculoskeletal conditions as part of its focus on occupational health. They promote ergonomic workplace design and practices to prevent repetitive strain injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome.
Cataract,"A clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is a bit like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window.","Most cataracts develop slowly as part of the aging process. Other causes include eye injuries, previous eye surgery, long-term use of steroid medications, diabetes, and excessive sun exposure.","Cloudy or blurry vision, colors appearing faded, glare or halos around lights, poor night vision, and frequent changes in eyeglass prescription.","Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet (UV) light. Don't smoke. Manage other health problems, especially diabetes. Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Get regular eye exams.","DISCLAIMER: Cataracts can only be corrected with surgery. There are no home remedies to reverse them. In the early stages, vision can be improved by using brighter lighting for reading and updating your eyeglass prescription.","Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide. The good news is that cataract surgery is a very common, safe, and highly effective procedure that restores vision by replacing the cloudy lens with an artificial one.","WHO's VISION 2020: The Right to Sight initiative has made cataract surgery a major priority. They work to increase access to affordable, high-quality cataract surgery, especially in low-income countries, to eliminate avoidable blindness."
Celiac Disease,A serious autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically predisposed people where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine.,"An autoimmune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response attacks the lining of the small intestine, impairing its ability to absorb nutrients.","Symptoms vary widely and can include digestive problems like diarrhea, bloating, and weight loss, as well as non-digestive symptoms like anemia, fatigue, skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), and joint pain.","Celiac disease cannot be prevented. However, for those diagnosed, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only way to prevent symptoms and intestinal damage.","DISCLAIMER: Celiac disease requires a medical diagnosis and lifelong management. The only treatment is a strict, 100% gluten-free diet. This involves carefully reading food labels and avoiding all foods containing wheat, barley, rye, and cross-contamination.","If left untreated, celiac disease can lead to serious long-term complications, including malnutrition, osteoporosis, and an increased risk of certain cancers. It is not a food allergy or intolerance; it's an autoimmune disease.","WHO recognizes celiac disease as a significant non-communicable digestive disease. They support clear food labeling laws, which are essential for individuals managing a gluten-free diet."
Cellulitis,"Cellulitis is a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin. It affects the deeper layers of the skin and the fat and soft tissues underneath. The infection causes redness, swelling, and pain in the affected area and can spread rapidly through the body if not treated promptly with antibiotics.","Cellulitis is typically caused by bacteria, most commonly *Streptococcus* and *Staphylococcus*, entering the body through a break in the skin. This entry point can be a cut, scrape, surgical wound, insect bite, or even dry, cracked skin. Risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing cellulitis include having a weakened immune system, skin conditions like eczema or athlete's foot, lymphedema (swelling), and obesity.","The main symptoms appear on the skin and include a red area that expands over time, swelling, warmth, and tenderness or pain in the affected area. The skin may look pitted, like an orange peel, and blisters can sometimes form. As the infection spreads, a person may also develop a fever, chills, and swollen lymph nodes.","Prevention focuses on good wound care and skin hygiene. Always clean any cuts or scrapes thoroughly with soap and water and cover them with a bandage. Keep your skin well-moisturized to prevent cracking, especially if you have dry skin. If you have underlying conditions like diabetes or poor circulation, inspect your feet and skin regularly for any injuries and manage your condition effectively.","Cellulitis requires medical treatment with prescription antibiotics and cannot be managed with home remedies alone. Supportive care at home is crucial during treatment. This includes taking the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by a doctor, resting, and elevating the affected limb to help reduce swelling. You can manage pain with over-the-counter pain relievers. **It is essential to see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment; do not attempt to self-treat.**","It's important to understand that cellulitis is more than just a simple skin rash. It can spread quickly and, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications like sepsis (a life-threatening infection of the bloodstream) or infection of the deeper tissues. Any area of skin that is red, swollen, warm, and expanding, especially if accompanied by a fever, requires immediate medical attention.","The World Health Organization (WHO) addresses cellulitis within its broader framework for managing skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Their guidance emphasizes the importance of early and accurate diagnosis to ensure appropriate treatment. A key focus is on the rational use of antibiotics to effectively treat the bacterial infection while combating the global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). WHO also promotes basic hygiene, sanitation, and proper wound care as fundamental preventative measures against such infections."
Cervical Cancer,A type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix â the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.,"Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are caused by a persistent infection with high-risk strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), a very common sexually transmitted virus.","Early-stage cervical cancer generally produces no signs or symptoms. Advanced stages may cause abnormal vaginal bleeding (e.g., after intercourse), unusual discharge, and pelvic pain.",The most effective precautions are vaccination against HPV and regular cervical cancer screening (Pap tests or HPV tests) to detect precancerous changes so they can be treated before cancer develops.,DISCLAIMER: Cancer requires professional medical treatment. There are NO effective home treatments. Home care involves following the prescribed treatment plan and managing side effects.,"Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer, as long as it is detected early and managed effectively. Screening and HPV vaccination are key.","WHO has launched a Global Strategy to Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer. Their ""90-70-90"" targets for 2030 aim for 90% of girls to be vaccinated against HPV, 70% of women to be screened, and 90% of women with cervical disease to receive treatment."
Cervicitis,Inflammation of the cervix. It's a common condition that can be caused by an infection or other non-infectious causes.,"Often caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like chlamydia or gonorrhea. It can also be caused by an overgrowth of normal vaginal bacteria, allergies to latex or spermicides, or irritation from a diaphragm.","Many women have no symptoms. When they occur, they can include grayish or yellow vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal bleeding, pain during intercourse, and frequent, painful urination.",Practice safe sex by using condoms to reduce the risk of STIs. Regular gynecological check-ups can help with early detection.,"DISCLAIMER: Cervicitis needs to be diagnosed and treated by a doctor, especially to rule out and treat STIs. Home care is not a substitute for medical treatment. Avoiding irritants like harsh soaps or douches.","It is important to get cervicitis treated because the underlying infection can spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to infertility.","WHO's programs on sexual and reproductive health emphasize the prevention, screening, and treatment of STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhea, which are major causes of cervicitis and can have serious long-term health consequences for women."
Chalazion,"A small, slow-growing lump or cyst that develops within the eyelid. It is caused by a blocked oil-producing gland (meibomian gland).","When the opening of an oil gland in the eyelid becomes clogged with hardened oil, the oil backs up into the gland, causing it to swell and become inflamed.","A painless lump or swelling on the upper or lower eyelid. It may become red, swollen, and tender if it gets inflamed. Large chalazia can press on the eyeball and cause blurry vision.","Practice good eyelid hygiene, especially if you have blepharitis (eyelid inflammation). Wash your eyelids daily with a gentle cleanser. Remove eye makeup thoroughly before sleeping.","DISCLAIMER: See a doctor if it doesn't improve or affects your vision. The primary home treatment is applying a warm, moist compress to the closed eyelid for 10-15 minutes, 4 to 6 times a day. This helps soften the hardened oil and promote drainage. Gently massage the eyelid afterward.","A chalazion is not a stye (hordeolum), which is a painful infection of an eyelash follicle. Most chalazia resolve on their own with warm compresses. Persistent or large ones may require a steroid injection or minor surgery.",WHO does not have specific guidelines for minor conditions like chalazion. General ophthalmology guidelines supported by WHO promote basic eye hygiene as part of primary eye care.
Chemical Poisoning,"Illness or death resulting from swallowing, inhaling, touching, or injecting various chemicals, drugs, venoms, or gases.","Exposure to toxic substances, which can be accidental (e.g., household cleaning products, pesticides, industrial chemicals, carbon monoxide) or intentional.","Symptoms vary widely depending on the poison but can include nausea, vomiting, burns in the mouth, difficulty breathing, drowsiness, confusion, or seizures.","Store all chemicals, medications, and cleaning products safely in locked cabinets, out of the reach of children. Use chemicals in well-ventilated areas. Install carbon monoxide detectors in your home.","DISCLAIMER: This is a medical emergency.

Chronic Kidney Disease,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition where the kidneys are damaged and gradually lose their ability to function effectively (filter waste, balance fluids/minerals, and regulate blood pressure). The damage develops over at least three months and is often irreversible. CKD can worsen over time, potentially leading to kidney failure (End-Stage Kidney Disease or ESKD), which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival. Early stages often show no symptoms.","The two leading causes of CKD worldwide are **Diabetes** (uncontrolled blood sugar damages the filters in the kidneys) and **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)** (high force of blood flow damages the kidney's small blood vessels). Other causes include: **Glomerulonephritis** (inflammation of the kidney's filtering units), **Polycystic Kidney Disease** (a genetic condition), autoimmune diseases (like Lupus), and recurrent kidney infections or obstructions.","Fatigue, swelling of the legs or ankles, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, increased urination or urine changes, blood in urine, high blood pressure","The best way to prevent or slow the progression of CKD is to manage the underlying causes and practice kidney-healthy habits:\n- **Strictly control blood pressure** (to target levels set by a doctor, often using ACE inhibitors or ARBs).\n- **Manage blood sugar** if you have diabetes, keeping it within the target range.\n- **Do not smoke** or use tobacco products.\n- **Maintain a healthy weight** and be physically active for at least 30 minutes most days.\n- **Avoid misuse of pain relievers** (NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen can damage the kidneys).","**CKD requires professional medical treatment and monitoring (Nephrologist).** Home management focuses on strict lifestyle and diet changes:\n- **Kidney-Friendly Diet:** Limit **sodium (salt)** intake (typically <2300 mg/day). Follow specific dietary guidance on **protein** intake (often reduced to minimize waste) and limit foods high in **potassium** (like bananas, potatoes, oranges) and **phosphorus** (like dairy, beans) as required by the CKD stage.\n- **Exercise:** Engage in regular, moderate physical activity to help control blood pressure and improve energy.\n- **Avoid Kidney Toxins:** Do not take over-the-counter pain relievers (NSAIDs) or herbal remedies without a doctor's approval.","CKD is often called a 'silent disease' because most people don't know they have it until the later stages, when treatment options are more limited. **Routine blood (eGFR) and urine (uACR/protein) tests** are the only way to detect CKD early. Early diagnosis, combined with aggressive control of blood pressure and blood sugar, is the most effective way to slow disease progression and prevent severe complications like heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure.","The WHO includes CKD as a key area within its global strategy for **Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)**, emphasizing that **Diabetes and Hypertension** management is critical for prevention. Guidelines promote integrating CKD screening and early management into primary healthcare, aiming to raise public awareness, reduce risk factors (tobacco, harmful alcohol use, unhealthy diet), and ensure timely, affordable access to treatment to slow the disease and prevent the need for kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant)."
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),A chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs.

Cold,"The common cold is a mild, self-limiting viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, primarily affecting the nose and throat. It is one of the most frequent illnesses worldwide and is generally harmless, though it can cause discomfort. Symptoms typically resolve on their own within one to two weeks. It is highly contagious.","The cold is caused by numerous viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common culprit. These viruses spread through airborne droplets released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. You can also get infected by touching a contaminated surface (like a doorknob) and then touching your own eyes, nose, or mouth.","Symptoms usually develop one to three days after exposure and include a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, coughing, and sneezing. Other possible symptoms are mild body aches, a slight headache, watery eyes, and a low-grade fever. Nasal discharge may start as clear and then thicken and turn yellow or green, which is a normal progression of the viral infection.","The best prevention is practicing good hygiene. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth. To prevent spreading the virus to others, always cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow, and stay home if you are feeling unwell.","A lemon a day keeps the cold away. For a bad cold, the juice of two lemons in Â½ a litre (2Â½ cups) of boiling water sweetened with honey, taken at bed time, is a very effective remedy. Have ginger (adrak) tea. Cut ginger (adrak) into 1"" _ 1Â½"" pieces and boil with a cup of water. Give 8-10 boils. Strain, sweeten with Â½ teaspoon sugar and drink hot. A tablespoon of carom seeds (ajwain) crushed and tied up in a muslin cloth can be used for inhalation to relieve congestion/blocked nose. A similar small bundle placed near the pillow of sleeping children relieves congestion. A teaspoon of cumin seeds (jeera) is added to 1 glass of boiling water. Strain and simmer for a few minutes. Let it cool. Drink it 1-2 times a day. If sore throat is also present, add a few small pieces of dry ginger (adrak) to the boiling water. Six pepper corns (saboot kali mirch) finely ground and mixed with a glass of warm water, sweetened with 5-6 batasha (a variation of sugar candy) can be taken for a few nights. In the case of the acute cold in the head, boil 1 tablespoon full pepper powder in a cup of milk along with a pinch of turmeric (haldi) and have once daily for at least 3 days. cold with phlegm (balgam) and slight cough. Take 8-10 tulsi leaves and wash well. To 1 cup of water, add these tulsi leaves, 1-2 cloves of garlic (lasan), Â½"" piece ginger, crushed and 4-5 peppercorns (saboot kali mirch). Boil the water and keep simmering on fire till the quantity is reduced to Â¼ cup. Cool. Strain. Add 1 teaspoon honey. Drink this every morning.","The common cold is a viral illness that gets better on its own. Using antibiotics for a cold is unnecessary and contributes to the global problem of antibiotic resistance. While symptoms are usually mild, it's important to distinguish them from the flu, which is often more severe with a high fever and significant body aches. See a doctor if symptoms are severe, persist for more than 10 days, or if you have a high fever.","The World Health Organization (WHO) addresses the common cold under its general guidance for acute respiratory infections. They strongly advocate for preventative measures like frequent handwashing and respiratory etiquette (covering coughs and sneezes). A key global health message promoted by WHO is the responsible use of antibiotics, emphasizing that they do not work on viruses and should not be used for the common cold. This is part of their broader strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR)."
Colic in Babies,"Colic is frequent, prolonged, and intense crying or fussiness in an otherwise **healthy infant**. It is characterized by crying that is **inconsolable** and occurs for no apparent reason. Colic is typically defined by the 'Rule of Threes': crying for **3 or more hours a day, 3 or more days a week, for 3 or more weeks**. It usually begins in the first few weeks after birth, **peaks around 6 weeks**, and resolves on its own around 3 to 4 months of age.","The **exact cause of colic is unknown** and likely multifactorial. Possible contributing factors include:\n- **Immature Digestive System:** An underdeveloped digestive system or temporary imbalance of healthy bacteria in the gut.\n- **Sensory Overload:** An **immature nervous system** that is overly sensitive to the environment (light, noise) and has difficulty 'self-soothing'.\n- **Digestive Discomfort:** Excessive gas (often swallowed air during crying), reflux, or rare food allergies/intolerances (such as cow's milk protein).","The main symptom is long periods of **inconsolable crying** that often occur at predictable times, frequently in the **evening**. During episodes, the baby may show signs of body tension:\n- **Loud, high-pitched crying** that sounds urgent or like they are in pain.\n- **Clenched fists, stiffened arms/legs, or arched back.**\n- **Legs pulled up over the tummy** or a tight, swollen belly.\n- **Facial flushing or turning bright red** after prolonged crying.\n- **Passing gas** or having a bowel movement, which may sometimes provide temporary relief.","There are no definitive precautions to prevent colic, but general measures focus on minimizing risk factors and ensuring the baby is not uncomfortable due to other causes:\n- **Proper Feeding:** Avoid **overfeeding or underfeeding**. Ensure the baby is burped frequently during and after feedings.\n- **Avoid Smoking:** Infants born to mothers who smoke during or after pregnancy have an increased risk.\n- **Rule Out Other Illnesses:** Always consult a healthcare provider to **rule out** other medical causes of excessive crying (e.g., infection, hernia, injury, severe reflux).",Boil a teaspoon of fennel seeds (saunf) in a cup of water. Boil for 2-3 minutes and keep it to cool for 15-20 minutes. Strain. Add 1-2 teaspoon to every feed of milk of the baby. It helps cure colic.,"Colic is **not harmful** to the baby and will **resolve on its own** (usually by 3-4 months). It is **not a result of bad parenting**. The biggest complication is the **stress and exhaustion** it causes parents, which increases the risk of postpartum depression and, rarely, shaking the baby. **Self-care is crucial:** It is okay to place the baby safely in the crib and leave the room for a few minutes to calm down when overwhelmed. Seek help from support systems or a mental health helpline.","The WHO emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis to **rule out organic disease** as the cause of crying. They stress **parental reassurance and support** as the cornerstone of management, highlighting that the condition is transient and harmless to the child.

Most cases are mild and resolve without long-term consequences.,WHO's programs for eye health include management of common infections like conjunctivitis at the primary care level. They emphasize hygiene and appropriate treatment to prevent outbreaks and complications.
Constipation In Adults,"Constipation is a common digestive complaint characterized by **infrequent bowel movements** (typically fewer than three per week) and/or the **difficult passage of hard, dry stool**. It is usually caused by lifestyle factors like poor diet, dehydration, or lack of exercise, but can also be a side effect of medications or a symptom of an underlying medical condition. It is generally manageable with dietary and lifestyle changes.","Constipation occurs when stool moves too slowly through the large intestine, causing too much water to be absorbed. Primary causes fall into a few categories:\n- **Dietary/Lifestyle:** **Not enough dietary fiber** (daily goal is 25-34g for adults), **dehydration** (not drinking enough fluids), **lack of physical activity**, **ignoring the urge** to pass stool, consuming large amounts of low-fiber foods (like processed foods, meat, and high-fat dairy), and **stress**.\n- **Medications:** Certain drugs, especially **opioid pain relievers**, antidepressants, some antacids, and calcium channel blockers.\n- **Medical Conditions:** Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), **diabetes**, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or conditions affecting the pelvic floor muscles. Pregnancy is also a common cause.","Fewer than three bowel movements per week, **hard, dry, or lumpy stools**, **straining** or pain when passing stools, a feeling of **incomplete emptying** of the bowels, a feeling that the rectum is blocked, or the need to use manual help to pass stool.","The best prevention is a high-fiber, high-fluid, active lifestyle:\n- **Increase Fiber Gradually:** Aim for 25-34 grams of fiber daily from fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains.\n- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water (8-10 glasses a day) and avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, which can cause dehydration.\n- **Be Active:** Exercise regularly (even walking helps).\n- **Establish a Routine:** Try to have a bowel movement at the same time each day (e.g., 15-45 minutes after breakfast). **Do not ignore the urge to defecate.**","A healthy stomach is a healthy body'. Many diseases have their roots in the digestive system. Constipation is a very common problem affecting a lot of people. Wrong eating habits, sedentary lifestyle & sluggish intestines are the main reasons. If the stomach is not cleared well, it leads to a lot of problems such as headaches, gas etc. However, use of laxatives should be discouraged as it is habit forming and also harmful in the long run. Here are some tips to relieve you of your problem. (It will take some time but be persistent and you will surely benefit) Take a hot glass of water with 1 teaspoon honey and juice of Â½ a lemon first thing in the morning. Drink one litre of water first thing in the morning. Soak 6-8 dates (khajoor) in a cup of water at night. Churn in the mixer in the morning & drink first thing in the morning. Consume approx. 250-300 gms fresh grapes (angoor) every day. When not in season, soak 12-15 raisins (kishmish) in water and have them. Raisins should be soaked for 24-48 hours and eaten early in the morning. The water in which they are soaked should also be drunk. Simply eat a few liquorice (mulathi) sticks. One of its many properties is that it is a natural laxative.","Chronic constipation can lead to complications such as **hemorrhoids**, anal fissures, and fecal impaction. **Seek immediate medical attention** if constipation is accompanied by **rectal bleeding** (blood in or on the stool), **unexplained weight loss**, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or if the constipation lasts longer than three weeks despite home treatment. These may be signs of a more serious underlying condition like a bowel obstruction or cancer.","The WHO promotes lifestyle changes for general digestive health, specifically advocating for diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, along with sufficient hydration and physical activity. While not issuing specific clinical guidelines for constipation, the focus aligns with preventing non-communicable diseases by addressing core risk factors (dietary fiber and physical inactivity) that directly contribute to the condition."
Coronary Artery Disease,"The most common type of heart disease. It develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients (coronary arteries) become damaged or diseased.","Caused by a buildup of cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in the arteries, a condition called atherosclerosis. This narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to the heart. Risk factors include high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking.","The most common symptom is chest pain (angina). Other symptoms can include shortness of breath and fatigue. For many, a heart attack is the first sign of the disease.","A heart-healthy lifestyle is the best precaution: don't smoke, eat a balanced diet low in saturated fat and salt, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, and manage blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes.","DISCLAIMER: This is a serious medical condition requiring lifelong management by a doctor. Home care involves strictly adhering to the prescribed lifestyle changes and medications. This includes preparing heart-healthy meals, engaging in regular physical activity as approved by your doctor, and managing stress.","CAD is a leading cause of death worldwide. It is a chronic disease that requires long-term management with lifestyle changes and medications to prevent a heart attack, heart failure, or other complications.","WHO's primary strategy to combat CAD is through the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This involves tackling risk factors like tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol on a global scale."
Cough,"A cough is a spontaneous and important reflex that acts to clear irritants, germs, and mucus from the airways and lungs. It is a common symptom of various conditions, ranging from simple viral infections to serious chronic diseases. An occasional cough is normal, but a cough that persists for more than 8 weeks is classified as **Chronic** and requires medical investigation.","Coughs are categorized by duration:\n- **Acute Cough** (lasting less than 3 weeks): Most commonly due to **Upper Respiratory Tract Infections** (common cold, flu, viral laryngitis), or **Lower Respiratory Tract Infections** (bronchitis, pneumonia).\n- **Chronic Cough** (lasting more than 8 weeks): Often caused by underlying chronic conditions, the 'big three' causes being: **Post-Nasal Drip** (now often termed Upper Airway Cough Syndrome or UACS), **Asthma** (or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis), and **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**. Other causes include smoking, certain medications (like ACE inhibitors), and chronic lung diseases (COPD).","Coughs can be **Productive** (bringing up phlegm/mucus) or **Dry/Nonproductive** (without mucus).\n- **Common:** Tickly or scratchy throat, a forceful push of air.\n- **Warning Signs (Seek urgent help):** Coughing up **blood** or bloody phlegm, **difficulty breathing** or **wheezing**, a **barking or whooping** sound, fever that lasts more than a couple of days, severe chest pain, or vomiting due to coughing fits.","Avoid respiratory irritants like **tobacco smoke** (firsthand and secondhand), dust, and strong fumes. **Wash hands frequently** and practice good respiratory hygiene (covering mouth/nose when coughing/sneezing) to prevent the spread of infections. Stay up to date with **vaccinations** (flu, COVID-19). Avoid sharing cups or utensils with sick people.","Mix equal amounts of honey and ginger (adrak) juice. For better results warm the mixture a little & then have it. Have 1 teaspoon, 2-3-4 times a day. Three pepper corns (saboot kali mirch) sucked with a pinch of black cumin (shah jeera) and a pinch of salt gives relief. Mix 1 teaspoon pepper powder with 4 teaspoon gur (jaggery). Make small balls. Suck 3-4 balls/tablets during the day. Mix equal amounts of pepper powder and sugar candy (mishri) by weight. Mix enough pure ghee to form small balls. Suck one ball/tablet 3-4 times a day. Avoid - curd, bananas, ice, rice fried and cold foods. 1 teaspoon of basil (tulsi) leaves juice 2-3 times a day for children. Tulsi leaves can be crushed to a paste and the paste squeezed through a clean muslin cloth to get juice. Mix a pinch of turmeric (haldi) with warm 1 cup milk and have at night.","A cough is the body's protective reflex, but a cough that lasts for an unusually long time (over 8 weeks) is often a sign of a treatable underlying problem and should be thoroughly investigated. For children, cold/cough remedies are generally **not recommended** due to risk of side effects and overdose. Any cough accompanied by difficulty breathing, chest pain, or blood requires **immediate medical attention**.","The WHO focuses on reducing the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), particularly in children. They recommend symptomatic therapies for the common cold (rest, fluids, soothing agents) but advise **against the routine use of over-the-counter cough and cold remedies** due to lack of evidence for efficacy and potential for toxicity, especially in young children. They stress that antibiotics should only be used if a more serious bacterial infection is suspected."
Crohnâs Disease,"A type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. It can affect any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus, but most commonly affects the end of the small intestine and the colon.",The exact cause is unknown but is believed to be an autoimmune reaction where the body's immune system attacks the gut. Genetics and environmental factors play a role.,"Symptoms can include persistent diarrhea, abdominal cramps and pain, rectal bleeding, fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and occur in flare-ups.","The cause is not known, so prevention is not possible. Avoiding smoking is important as it is a major risk factor for developing Crohn's and can worsen the disease.","DISCLAIMER: Crohn's is a chronic disease requiring medical management. Home care focuses on managing symptoms during flares and maintaining remission. During a flare, eating soft, bland foods may help. Keeping a food diary to identify personal trigger foods. Managing stress through techniques like meditation or yoga.","Crohn's disease is a lifelong condition with periods of remission and relapse. There is no cure, but treatments (medications and sometimes surgery) can greatly reduce inflammation and control symptoms.","WHO classifies Crohn's disease as a significant non-communicable digestive disease. Their focus is on strengthening health systems to provide long-term, integrated care for patients with chronic conditions."
Cryptococcosis,"Cryptococcosis is a potentially life-threatening fungal infection caused by breathing in microscopic spores of the *Cryptococcus* fungus. While it can infect the lungs, it is most dangerous when it spreads through the bloodstream to the brain, causing cryptococcal meningitis. The disease primarily affects people with weakened immune systems, and it is a leading cause of death among people with advanced HIV/AIDS.","The infection is caused by the fungi *Cryptococcus neoformans* and *Cryptococcus gattii*. These fungi are found in the natural environment, typically in soil that is contaminated with bird droppings, especially from pigeons. A person gets infected by inhaling the airborne fungal spores. The disease is not contagious and does not spread from person to person.","Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. In the lungs (pulmonary cryptococcosis), symptoms can be mild and include cough, shortness of breath, and fever. When the infection spreads to the brain (cryptococcal meningitis), symptoms are severe and include a persistent headache, fever, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and confusion or behavioral changes.","For healthy individuals, no special precautions are needed. However, people with compromised immune systems (e.g., those with advanced HIV, organ transplant recipients) should try to avoid exposure to areas with a high concentration of bird droppings, such as old buildings, construction sites, or parks where pigeons gather. For people with HIV, the most important preventive measure is adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) to maintain a strong immune system.","There is NO home treatment for cryptococcosis. It is a serious medical emergency that requires hospitalization and aggressive treatment with prescription intravenous (IV) and oral antifungal medications, often for a long duration. Any 'home care' is strictly post-hospitalization and involves meticulously following the long-term antifungal medication plan prescribed by a doctor to prevent a relapse.","It's crucial to understand that while the *Cryptococcus* fungus is common in the environment, it rarely causes illness in people with healthy immune systems. The primary risk is for immunocompromised individuals. For this group, any new onset of a severe headache, stiff neck, or confusion should be treated as a medical emergency to rule out cryptococcal meningitis, as early diagnosis and treatment are critical for survival.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has specific guidelines for managing cryptococcal disease, recognizing it as a major opportunistic infection and cause of death in people with advanced HIV disease. WHO recommends screening for the cryptococcal antigen in HIV-positive adults with a low CD4 count (<200 cells/ÂµL) to detect the infection before meningitis develops. Their treatment guidelines detail a phased approach using specific antifungal medicines (Amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole) for induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy."
Cushing Syndrome,A condition that occurs from exposure to high levels of the hormone cortisol for a long time.,"The most common cause is the long-term use of high-dose corticosteroid medications. It can also be caused by the body overproducing cortisol, due to a tumor on the pituitary gland or an adrenal gland.","Weight gain and fatty deposits, particularly around the midsection and upper back, in the face (moon face), and between the shoulders (buffalo hump). Other symptoms include pink or purple stretch marks, thinning skin that bruises easily, and high blood pressure.","If the cause is long-term steroid use, precautions include using the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time under a doctor's supervision.","DISCLAIMER: Cushing syndrome requires a medical diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause. Home care is supportive. Following a nutritious, balanced diet that is low in sodium and sugar to help control weight gain and blood pressure, as advised by your doctor.","Treatment depends on the cause and aims to lower the high levels of cortisol in the body. This may involve gradually reducing steroid medication, surgery, or radiation.","WHO's list of essential medicines includes corticosteroids, but they also promote guidelines on their rational use to minimize adverse effects like iatrogenic (medication-induced) Cushing syndrome."
Cystic Fibrosis,"A progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time.","Caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene. This gene provides instructions for a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people with CF, the protein does not work correctly, causing thick, sticky mucus and salty sweat.","Symptoms include a persistent cough with thick mucus, frequent lung infections, wheezing or shortness of breath, poor growth or weight gain despite a good appetite, and frequent greasy, bulky stools.","CF is a genetic disease and cannot be prevented. Genetic screening for carriers can be done for couples planning a family, especially if there is a family history of the disease.","DISCLAIMER: CF is a complex, lifelong disease requiring specialized medical care. Home management is a critical part of the treatment plan. This includes daily airway clearance techniques to remove mucus, taking pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals, and following a high-calorie, high-fat diet.","Great strides have been made in treating CF, and people with the condition are now living much longer lives. Management is complex and involves a team of healthcare professionals.","WHO recognizes cystic fibrosis as a serious genetic disorder. They support the development of national programs for the prevention and management of genetic diseases, including newborn screening programs which allow for early diagnosis and treatment."
Dandruff,"A common scalp condition where the skin on the scalp flakes off. It's not contagious or a sign of poor hygiene, but it can be embarrassing.","The exact cause is unclear but is linked to a common fungus called Malassezia, oily or irritated skin, dry skin, and sensitivity to hair care products.","White or yellowish flakes on hair and shoulders, itchy scalp, scaly or red patches on the scalp.",Regular shampooing with a medicated anti-dandruff shampoo containing ingredients like zinc pyrithione or selenium sulfide. Managing stress and avoiding harsh hair products can also help.,Soak 2 tablespoon fenugreek seeds (methi dana) in water overnight. In the morning grind into a fine paste. Apply all over scalp and leave for Â½ an hour. Wash with Shikakai or mild shampoo. Boil a handful of neem leaves in 4 teacups of water. After cooling and filtering use for rinsing hair Dehydration due to diarrhoea Soak half a nutmeg (jaiphal) in 2 cups water for over 2-3 hours. Take 1 teaspoon of this infusion and mix in 1 cup fresh coconut water. Drink twice or thrice a day.,"Dandruff is a manageable cosmetic issue, not a serious medical illness. If over-the-counter treatments fail or the scalp is very inflamed, a dermatologist should be consulted.","WHO does not issue specific global guidelines for dandruff as it is a non-communicable, non-life-threatening condition. General recommendations on skin health emphasize hygiene and professional care for persistent issues."
Deafness,"Hearing loss, ranging from mild to profound, which can affect one or both ears. It impacts communication and can lead to social isolation.","Congenital causes, chronic ear infections, exposure to excessive noise, aging (presbycusis), head injury, and certain medications or diseases like meningitis.","Difficulty understanding words, especially in noise; needing to turn up the volume of TV/radio; muffled sounds; ringing in the ears (tinnitus).","Avoiding exposure to loud noises by using hearing protection, prompt treatment for ear infections, and getting vaccinated against diseases like measles and meningitis.",Use raw onion juice as ear drops. Put two drops of lukewarm neem oil inside the ear.,"Over 5% of the world's population has disabling hearing loss. Early detection, especially in children, is crucial. With hearing aids, cochlear implants, and sign language, people can live full lives.","WHO promotes ear and hearing care through its 'World Report on Hearing'. It focuses on prevention (e.g., safe listening), early screening, and improving access to affordable, high-quality hearing technology and support services."
Dehydration,"A condition where the body loses more fluid than it takes in, preventing normal bodily functions. It can range from mild to life-threatening.","Not drinking enough water, excessive sweating, severe diarrhea, vomiting, fever, or increased urination (due to diabetes or certain medications).","Thirst, dark-colored urine, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, confusion. In infants, a sunken soft spot (fontanel) on the head is a key sign.","Drink plenty of fluids (especially water) throughout the day, particularly in hot weather or when exercising. Increase fluid intake during illness, especially with fever, vomiting, or diarrhea.","Add Â¼ teaspoon salt, 3 teaspoon brown sugar or ordinary sugar and 2 teaspoon lime juice to 1 cup of water, mix well and drink.",Thirst is an early warning sign. Don't wait until you're thirsty to drink. Dehydration is especially dangerous for young children and older adults. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency.,"WHO strongly advocates for Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) solution to treat dehydration from diarrhea. This simple mixture of clean water, salt, and sugar is credited with saving millions of lives, particularly children."
Delivery Of Babies,"Known as childbirth, it is the process of a baby leaving the uterus. It can occur vaginally or through a surgical procedure called a caesarean section.","It is the natural conclusion of a full-term pregnancy, initiated by hormonal signals that cause the uterus to contract and push the baby out.","Signs of labor include regular, strengthening contractions; a ""bloody show"" (mucus plug); lower back pain; and the rupture of the amniotic sac (""water breaking"").",Consistent prenatal care throughout pregnancy is the most important precaution to monitor maternal and fetal health and prepare for a safe delivery.,"Mix 3 teaspoon lime juice, Â¼ teaspoon powdered black pepper and 1 teaspoon honey in 1 cup water. Drink for 3 months.","Access to skilled care from a doctor, nurse, or midwife during childbirth is critical to prevent maternal and newborn deaths. A positive childbirth experience is important for the mother's well-being.","WHO's vision is that ""every pregnant woman and newborn receives quality care"". They provide evidence-based guidelines to ensure safe and respectful maternity care, promoting natural labor and reducing unnecessary medical interventions."
Dengue Fever,"A mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.",Caused by one of four related dengue viruses. It is spread by the bite of an infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. The mosquito gets the virus by biting an infected person.,"High fever, severe headache, severe pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and a skin rash. A more severe form, dengue hemorrhagic fever, can be fatal.","The only way to prevent dengue is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. Use insect repellent, wear protective clothing, sleep under a mosquito net, and eliminate mosquito breeding sites by removing standing water.","DISCLAIMER: Dengue requires medical monitoring. Seek medical advice if you suspect you have dengue. Home care focuses on symptom relief. Get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids (water, ORS) to prevent dehydration, and take paracetamol to reduce fever and pain. Do NOT take aspirin or ibuprofen.","Most people recover within a week or so. However, some people develop severe dengue, which is a medical emergency requiring hospitalization. Warning signs include severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, and bleeding.","WHO's global strategy for dengue prevention and control aims to reduce mortality by 50% and morbidity by 25% by 2020. This focuses on integrated vector management, surveillance, and case management."
Dental Problems,"A broad term for conditions affecting the teeth, gums, and mouth, including tooth decay (cavities), gum disease (gingivitis), and infections.","Poor oral hygiene that allows plaque (a bacterial film) to build up, combined with a sugary diet, tobacco use, and lack of regular dental check-ups.","Toothache, bleeding or swollen gums, pain when chewing, persistent bad breath, sensitivity to hot or cold, loose teeth.","Brush teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss once a day, limit sugary foods and drinks, avoid tobacco, and see a dentist regularly for cleanings and check-ups.","Turmeric (haldi), burnt, and finely powdered, can be used as toothpowder.",Oral health is a window to your overall health. Many dental problems are preventable. Untreated gum disease is linked to other serious conditions like heart disease and diabetes.,"WHO considers oral diseases a major public health problem. Its strategy focuses on integrating oral health into primary care, promoting fluoride use, and advocating for policies that reduce sugar consumption."
Depression,"A serious mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and a loss of interest in activities. It affects how you feel, think, and behave.","A complex mix of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Brain chemistry, stressful life events, and family history can all contribute.","Persistent low mood, loss of pleasure, changes in sleep or appetite, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of self-harm.","While not fully preventable, managing stress, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, building strong social connections, and seeking early help for mental health concerns can reduce risk.",Boil Â¼ teaspoon powdered cardamom (chhoti illaichi) seeds in thin tea water and drink. Mix 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg (jaiphal) powder with 1 tablespoon freshly extracted amla juice. Take 3 times a day.,"Depression is a treatable medical illness, not a sign of personal weakness. Stigma prevents many from seeking help. Talking openly and seeking professional support is key to recovery.",WHO recognizes depression as a leading cause of disability worldwide. Their Mental Health Action Plan advocates for integrating mental health services into primary care to improve access to evidence-based psychological therapies and medication.
Dermatitis,"A general term for inflammation of the skin. It can have many causes and occurs in many forms. It usually involves an itchy rash on swollen, reddened skin.","Common types include atopic dermatitis (eczema), which is linked to genetics and allergies; contact dermatitis, caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen; and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff).","Itchy, dry skin or a rash on swollen, reddened skin. The skin may blister, ooze, crust, or flake off. The appearance varies depending on the type of dermatitis.","For contact dermatitis, identify and avoid the substance that causes the reaction. For eczema, keep skin well-moisturized and avoid known triggers. Use gentle, fragrance-free soaps and laundry detergents.","DISCLAIMER: A doctor can help identify the type and best treatment. For general relief, apply cool, wet compresses to the affected skin. Take a cool bath with baking soda or oatmeal. Use over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream for itching. Keep skin moisturized. Avoid scratching.","Dermatitis is a common condition that is not contagious. While it can be uncomfortable and persistent, it is manageable with proper skincare and medical treatment.",WHO does not have specific programs for dermatitis itself but includes it under the broad category of skin diseases. They promote access to basic dermatological care within primary health systems.
Diabetes,"A chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces, leading to high blood sugar.",Type 1 is an autoimmune condition. Type 2 (most common) is linked to genetics and lifestyle factors like obesity and physical inactivity. Gestational diabetes occurs in pregnancy.,"Frequent urination, increased thirst, constant hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision. Many people with Type 2 have no initial symptoms.","Maintaining a healthy weight, regular physical activity, and a balanced diet can prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes. Management involves diet, exercise, blood sugar monitoring, and medication.","For diabetes, diet restriction & light exercise like walking is a must as this controls the sugar level. Grape fruit is a splendid thing in the diet of a diabetic. Have 3 fruits at a time, 3 times daily. A tablespoon of amla juice mixed with a cup of fresh bitter gourd (karela ) juice and taken daily for 2 months will reduce blood sugar. Take dry tender leaves of the mango tree in the shade. Powder and preserve them. Half a teaspoon of this powder twice a day in the morning and evening proves beneficial. 3-4 teaspoons juice of bitter gourd (karela), taken every morning on an empty stomach gives good results. Coarsely powder fenugreek seeds (methi dana) and have 1-2 teaspoon in the morning everyday. (Vary dosage according to individual tolerance level). Eating 10 fresh fully grown curry leaves (kari patta) every morning for 3 months is said to prevent diabetes due to heredity factors. Soak 2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi dana) in 1 cup water at night. Drink this water first thing in the morning and preferably eat the seeds too. Chew 8-10 basil (tulsi) leaves in the morning.","Diabetes is a global epidemic. If unmanaged, it can lead to severe complications like heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and blindness. Early diagnosis and lifestyle changes are critical.",WHO's Global Diabetes Compact aims to improve prevention and access to care. It sets targets to reduce obesity and ensure 80% of people with diabetes are diagnosed and have good control of their blood pressure and glucose levels.
Diabetes Insipidus,"A rare disorder that causes an imbalance of fluids in the body. This imbalance leads to intense thirst even after drinking, and the excretion of large amounts of urine.","Caused by problems with a hormone called vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone or ADH). It can result from damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, a defect in the kidneys' response to ADH, or during pregnancy. It is NOT related to diabetes mellitus.","The main symptoms are extreme thirst (polydipsia) and passing large volumes of pale, diluted urine (polyuria), often needing to urinate frequently, including throughout the night.",Most types of DI cannot be prevented. Preventing head injuries can reduce the risk of the central type.,DISCLAIMER: This condition requires a medical diagnosis and treatment plan. The most important part of home management is to drink enough water to prevent dehydration. The doctor will prescribe medication (like desmopressin) to control the condition.,"While the name is similar, diabetes insipidus is completely different from diabetes mellitus (the common form of diabetes related to blood sugar). With treatment, DI can be well-managed.",WHO does not have specific guidelines for this rare disorder. It is managed within the field of endocrinology. WHO's work on strengthening health systems helps ensure that people with rare diseases can access the specialized diagnostic tests and treatments they need.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis,"A serious, life-threatening complication of diabetes that occurs when your body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. It develops when your body can't produce enough insulin.","Most often occurs in people with type 1 diabetes. It can be triggered by an illness or infection, a problem with insulin therapy (e.g., a missed dose or pump failure), or undiagnosed diabetes.","Symptoms develop quickly and include excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, fruity-scented breath, and confusion.","For people with diagnosed diabetes, the key is good diabetes management: monitor blood sugar regularly, take insulin as directed, and have a ""sick day plan"" from your doctor for how to manage your diabetes when you are ill.","DISCLAIMER: DKA is a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization. There are NO home treatments. If you have diabetes and your blood sugar is high with ketones present in your urine, seek emergency medical care.","DKA can lead to a diabetic coma or death if not treated promptly. Treatment involves intravenous fluids to correct dehydration, insulin to lower blood sugar, and replacement of electrolytes.",WHO's Global Diabetes Compact and other diabetes programs emphasize patient education as a cornerstone of diabetes management. This includes teaching people how to monitor their blood sugar and ketones and when to seek emergency care to prevent complications like DKA.
Diabetic Retinopathy,A diabetes complication that affects the eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).,"Caused by long-term high blood sugar levels from diabetes, which damage the small blood vessels in the retina. High blood pressure and high cholesterol also contribute to the risk.","Early stages may have no symptoms. As it progresses, symptoms can include spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters), blurred vision, fluctuating vision, and vision loss.","The most important precaution is strict management of diabetes: keep blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels under control. Get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year.",DISCLAIMER: This condition requires management by an ophthalmologist. Home care is about prevention and slowing progression.

Diaper Rash,A common form of inflamed skin (dermatitis) that appears as a patchwork of bright red skin on a baby's bottom.,"Usually caused by prolonged contact with wet or soiled diapers. The moisture, friction from the diaper, and irritation from urine and stool break down the skin's protective barrier. It can also be caused by a yeast infection.","Red, tender-looking skin in the diaper region â buttocks, thighs, and genitals. The baby may seem more fussy than usual, especially during diaper changes.",Change wet or dirty diapers promptly. Clean the diaper area gently with water or mild wipes. Pat the skin dry or allow it to air dry. Apply a thick layer of a barrier cream (with zinc oxide or petroleum jelly) at each diaper change. Allow for some diaper-free time.,"DISCLAIMER: Most diaper rash can be treated at home. If the rash is severe, doesn't improve in a few days, or has blisters or open sores, see a doctor. Following the preventative measures above is the best treatment.","Diaper rash is very common and usually not serious. With good home care, it typically clears up within a few days. If it persists, it may be complicated by a fungal or bacterial infection that needs medical treatment.","WHO's guidelines for newborn and infant care promote practices that prevent skin problems, including keeping the baby clean and dry."
Diarrhea due to indigestion of food,"Loose, watery stools caused by the digestive system's inability to properly break down certain foods.","Eating foods one is intolerant or sensitive to (e.g., lactose, gluten), overeating, or consuming rich, spicy, or fatty foods that irritate the digestive system.","Abdominal cramps, bloating, gas, and loose stools that occur shortly after eating the trigger food.","Identify and avoid personal food triggers. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid lying down immediately after eating.",Insert Â¼ teaspoon nutmeg (jaiphal) powder inside a ripe banana and eat. Dog-bite Take Â½ teaspoon powder of black cumin seeds (shah jeera) twice daily.,This is usually a temporary issue that resolves on its own. It's important to distinguish it from infectious diarrhea. Keeping a food diary can help identify problematic foods.,"WHO guidelines focus on infectious diarrhea, but the management principle of maintaining hydration is universal. For indigestion-related issues, general health advice emphasizes a balanced diet."
Diarrhoea,"The passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day. It is a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by various bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms.","Infection from contaminated food or drinking water, or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene. Rotavirus and E. coli are common causes.","Loose, watery stools; abdominal cramps; fever; nausea; vomiting; and an urgent need to use the toilet. Dehydration is the main danger.","Practice good hygiene, especially handwashing with soap. Ensure access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation. Food safety practices are essential.","Combine 1 teaspoon each powdered ginger (adrak), powdered cumin (jeera) and powdered cinnamon (dalchini) with honey and make into a thick paste.

They also promote breastfeeding, immunizations (especially for rotavirus), and improving water and sanitation."
Diphtheria,A serious bacterial infection that usually affects the mucous membranes of the nose and throat.,"Caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It spreads from person to person, usually through respiratory droplets from a cough or sneeze.","A thick, gray membrane covering the throat and tonsils is the classic sign. Other symptoms include a sore throat, swollen glands in the neck, weakness, and fever. The bacteria produce a toxin that can damage the heart, nerves, and kidneys.",The most effective precaution is vaccination. The diphtheria vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunization schedule (usually combined with tetanus and pertussis - DTaP).,DISCLAIMER: Diphtheria is a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization and treatment with antitoxin and antibiotics. There are NO home treatments.,"Diphtheria can be fatal, even with treatment. The toxin can cause life-threatening complications. Vaccination is the key to prevention.",WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) has made the diphtheria vaccine a standard part of routine childhood immunizations globally. This has dramatically reduced the incidence of the disease worldwide.
Diverticulitis,"A condition where small, bulging pouches (diverticula) that can form in the lining of the digestive system, usually in the colon, become inflamed or infected.","The inflammation or infection occurs when the pouches get blocked with waste, allowing bacteria to build up. The reason the pouches (diverticulosis) form in the first place is thought to be related to a long-term low-fiber diet.","The most common symptom is persistent, severe abdominal pain, usually in the lower left side. Other symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, and a change in bowel habits.","To help prevent the formation of diverticula, eat a high-fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Drink plenty of water and exercise regularly.","DISCLAIMER: Acute diverticulitis requires medical treatment, often with antibiotics. During an acute attack, a doctor may recommend a clear liquid diet for a few days to let the colon rest, followed by a gradual return to a high-fiber diet after recovery.",Mild diverticulitis can be treated with rest and antibiotics. Severe or recurrent cases may require hospitalization or surgery. A high-fiber diet is recommended after recovery to prevent future flare-ups.,"WHO promotes healthy diets, including adequate fiber intake, as part of its strategy to prevent non-communicable diseases. This dietary advice also serves as a primary prevention strategy for diverticular disease."
Down Syndrome,A genetic condition in which a person is born with an extra copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome.,"It is a naturally occurring chromosomal arrangement that is not caused by anything the parents did before or during pregnancy. The risk increases with the mother's age, but most babies with Down syndrome are born to younger mothers because of higher birth rates in this group.","Common physical traits include a flattened face, almond-shaped eyes that slant up, a short neck, and small hands and feet. All people with Down syndrome experience some degree of cognitive delays, but the level of intellectual disability varies.",Down syndrome is a genetic condition and cannot be prevented. Prenatal screening can detect the likelihood of the condition during pregnancy.,"DISCLAIMER: Down syndrome is a lifelong condition, not an illness to be treated at home. Home life should focus on providing a stimulating and supportive environment, early intervention services (speech, occupational, physical therapy), and inclusive education to help the individual reach their full potential.","People with Down syndrome can live full and productive lives. Early intervention and inclusive support make a significant difference. They have an increased risk for certain medical conditions, such as heart defects and hearing problems, so regular medical care is important.","WHO works to ensure that people with developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome, have access to the health services, education, and social support they need to achieve their full potential and enjoy their human rights."
Drug Allergy,"An abnormal reaction of your immune system to a medication. Any medication â over-the-counter, prescription, or herbal â can induce a drug allergy.","The immune system mistakenly identifies a drug as a harmful substance (an allergen). It then produces antibodies to attack the substance, leading to allergic symptoms.","Symptoms can range from mild (skin rash, hives, itching) to severe. A severe, life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can cause difficulty breathing, dizziness, and loss of consciousness.","If you have a known drug allergy, the only way to prevent a reaction is to avoid that drug. Always inform your doctors and pharmacist of any drug allergies you have. Wearing a medical alert bracelet can be life-saving.","DISCLAIMER: A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is a medical emergency. Use an epinephrine auto-injector if you have one and call for emergency help. For a mild rash, an over-the-counter antihistamine may help, but you should still inform your doctor about the reaction.","It's important to distinguish a true drug allergy from a drug side effect, which does not involve the immune system. A doctor can help determine this.

However, patient-reported symptoms like feverishness are recognized as important clinical signs that warrant attention in primary healthcare settings."
Fibromyalgia,"A chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues.","The exact cause is unknown, but it likely involves a variety of genetic and environmental factors. It is thought to be a problem with how the central nervous system processes pain signals.","The primary symptom is widespread pain, often described as a constant dull ache, on both sides of the body. Other key symptoms include profound fatigue and cognitive difficulties (""fibro fog"").","The cause is not known, so prevention is not possible.","DISCLAIMER: Fibromyalgia requires a comprehensive management plan from a doctor. Home care is crucial for managing symptoms. Engaging in regular, low-impact exercise (like walking or swimming), practicing good sleep hygiene, and using stress-reduction techniques like meditation, yoga, or tai chi.","Fibromyalgia is a real and debilitating condition, not ""just in your head."" There is no cure, but a combination of medication, exercise, and stress management can help control symptoms and improve quality of life.","WHO classifies fibromyalgia as a musculoskeletal condition. They support a multidisciplinary approach to managing chronic pain conditions, including patient education, physical therapy, and psychological support."
Flatulence,The passage of intestinal gas (flatus) from the digestive system out of the back passage. It is a normal biological process.,"Caused by swallowed air (aerophagia) and the breakdown of undigested foods by bacteria in the large intestine. Certain foods like beans, cabbage, and onions are known to produce more gas.","Passing gas, abdominal bloating, and sometimes abdominal pain or discomfort.",Eat and drink slowly to avoid swallowing air. Avoid or reduce intake of gas-producing foods. Regular exercise can help improve digestion.,"Soak 3 tablespoon carom (ajwain) seeds in an adequate quantity of lime juice and dry in the shade. When fully dried, powder with a little black salt. Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice daily for a few days with a little warm water.","Passing gas 10-20 times a day is normal. Excessive or foul-smelling flatulence is usually related to diet and not a sign of a serious problem, though it can sometimes be linked to digestive disorders.","WHO's general dietary guidelines recommend a balanced intake of foods, including fiber-rich vegetables and legumes. While these can cause gas, their health benefits are significant. Managing gas is about dietary balance."
Food Poisoning,"An illness caused by eating contaminated food. Infectious organisms â including bacteria, viruses, and parasites â or their toxins are the most common causes.","Caused by consuming food or drink contaminated with harmful germs. This often happens due to improper handling, cooking, or storage of food. Common culprits include Norovirus, Salmonella, and E. coli.","Symptoms vary but commonly include nausea, vomiting, watery or bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cramps. Fever may also be present.",Practice food safety: Clean hands and surfaces often. Separate raw meats from other foods. Cook foods to the proper temperature. Chill perishable foods promptly.,"DISCLAIMER: See a doctor if you have severe symptoms like high fever, bloody diarrhea, or signs of dehydration. For mild cases, the focus is on rest and hydration. Let your stomach settle, then gradually begin eating bland, low-fat foods (BRAT diet: bananas, rice, applesauce, toast). Drink plenty of fluids, including ORS, to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.",Most cases of food poisoning are mild and resolve without treatment within a few days. The main complication is dehydration. Certain types of food poisoning can be very serious.,"WHO's ""Five Keys to Safer Food"" (Keep clean, Separate raw and cooked, Cook thoroughly, Keep food at safe temperatures, Use safe water and raw materials) is a global public health message aimed at preventing foodborne illnesses at home and in food service."
Foot Corns,"Small, tender areas of thickened skin that develop on the tops and sides of toes or on the sole of the foot due to pressure or friction.",Caused by repeated friction and pressure from ill-fitting shoes that are too tight or from foot deformities like bunions or hammertoes.,"A hard, raised lump of skin, often with a dense core. It can be painful when pressed. Soft corns can develop between the toes where the skin is moist.",Wear shoes that fit properly and have a wide toe box. Use protective padding like moleskin to reduce pressure on the affected area.,Tie a fresh slice of lemon over the corn (painful area) and keep it all night. Massage castor oil on the corns every morning and night before sleeping. Massage for 2-3 minutes so that the oil gets absorbed. In 3-4 weeks the corns will disappear. Mash 1-2 cloves (laung) & garlic (lasan) and tie over the corns. Keep overnight.,"Corns are the body's way of protecting the skin from damage. They are not contagious. Attempting to cut them off at home can lead to infection, especially for people with diabetes.","WHO's guidelines on diabetes management include a strong focus on preventative foot care, which includes wearing proper footwear to avoid pressure points that lead to corns and calluses, which can break down into ulcers."
For Ear pain due to boils use the folowing :,"Pain caused by a small, localized infection (a boil or furuncle) in the hair follicle or oil gland inside the ear canal.","The infection is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria entering a hair follicle, often after minor skin trauma from cleaning or scratching the ear.","Sharp, intense, localized pain in the ear canal that worsens when the outer ear is touched or pulled. There might be a small, red, swollen bump visible.","Avoid inserting objects like cotton swabs or fingers into your ears, as this can damage the skin and introduce bacteria. Keep ears clean and dry.","Heat 1 teaspoon each of garlic (lasan) and carom seeds (ajwain) in 2 tablespoon gingelly oil (til ka tel) till they turn red in colour. Strain and cool. When cooled to body temperature, put some drops into the ears.","Do not try to squeeze or pop a boil in the ear canal, as this can push the infection deeper. It is a very painful but usually not serious condition that needs medical treatment.","WHO guidelines for primary ear care emphasize avoiding harmful practices like using cotton swabs. For infections, they recommend diagnosis by a health worker and appropriate treatment, which may include antibiotics."
Fungal Nail Infection,"A common infection of the fingernails or toenails that can cause them to become discolored, thick, and more likely to crack and break. Also known as onychomycosis.","Caused by various fungal organisms (fungi). The most common type is dermatophyte. Fungi thrive in warm, moist environments, so sweaty feet and walking barefoot in public areas like pools and gyms are risk factors.","Nails may appear thickened, brittle, crumbly, distorted in shape, and have a yellowish or brownish discoloration. The nail may separate from the nail bed.",Keep your hands and feet clean and dry. Wear sweat-absorbing socks and breathable shoes. Avoid walking barefoot in public damp areas. Don't share nail clippers.,"DISCLAIMER: Fungal nail infections can be difficult to treat and often require prescription medication. Over-the-counter creams are less effective. Soaking the affected foot in a solution of one part vinegar and two parts warm water for 15-20 minutes daily may help some people, but medical treatment is usually necessary for a cure.","This is primarily a cosmetic issue for many, but for people with diabetes or weakened immune systems, it can lead to more serious complications. Treatment can be long, often involving months of oral antifungal medication.","WHO does not have specific guidelines for this common, non-life-threatening infection. It is managed based on standard dermatological practice."
Gallstones,Hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can form in your gallbladder. They can range in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball.,"Gallstones may form if your bile contains too much cholesterol or too much bilirubin, or if your gallbladder doesn't empty correctly. Risk factors include being female, obesity, and rapid weight loss.","Many people with gallstones have no symptoms. If a gallstone lodges in a duct and causes a blockage, it can result in a sudden, intense pain in the upper right abdomen (biliary colic), often after a fatty meal.","To reduce your risk, maintain a healthy weight, avoid rapid weight loss, and eat a high-fiber diet with healthy fats.","DISCLAIMER: Gallstone attacks can be very painful and may lead to complications requiring medical intervention. If you have symptoms, see a doctor. During an attack, there is little to do at home but wait for it to pass. Some people find that a heating pad can provide some comfort. Avoiding fatty foods may prevent future attacks.","Treatment is usually not needed unless you are having symptoms. If you have frequent attacks, the most common treatment is surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy).","WHO includes cholecystectomy as an essential surgical procedure, recognizing that symptomatic gallstone disease is a common condition that can lead to serious complications and requires surgical intervention."
Gas Problem,"A general term for discomfort in the digestive tract caused by excess gas, leading to bloating, belching, and flatulence.",A combination of swallowing air while eating or drinking and the normal breakdown of certain undigested foods by gut bacteria.,"A feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen (bloating), belching (burping), and passing gas (flatulence).",Eat slowly and chew food thoroughly. Avoid carbonated beverages and chewing gum. Identify and limit foods that cause personal discomfort.,"Some people are allergic or have intolerance for milk, milk products and wheat, wheat products but go through life without ever realizing this and keep suffering from acute gas trouble. Lactose intolerance (from milk) is being recognized in the west as also gluten intolerance (from wheat). Hence giving up these two things may greatly benefit you. Instead of wheat you can have rice or chapatis of maize, jawar or bajara. w Mix Â¼ teaspoon dry ginger powder (sonth) with a pinch of asafoetida (hing).","Gas is a normal part of digestion. The amount produced varies greatly among individuals. While often just uncomfortable, excessive gas can sometimes signal a digestive disorder like IBS or lactose intolerance.","WHO promotes healthy diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber. While fiber can increase gas production, its benefits for digestive and overall health are paramount. Gradual dietary changes can help manage gas."
Gastric Ulcer,"Also known as a stomach ulcer, this is an open sore that develops on the lining of the stomach. It is a type of peptic ulcer disease.",The two most common causes are infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and aspirin.,"The most common symptom is a burning or gnawing stomach pain, which may be either relieved or worsened by eating. Other symptoms include bloating, belching, and nausea.","To reduce your risk, avoid long-term NSAID use if possible. Practice good hygiene to prevent H. pylori infection. Don't smoke and limit alcohol.","DISCLAIMER: Ulcers require a medical diagnosis and treatment to eradicate H. pylori or stop NSAID use. Home care can help manage symptoms. Avoiding foods that cause irritation, such as spicy, acidic, or fatty foods. Managing stress. Not smoking.","If left untreated, gastric ulcers can lead to serious complications like bleeding, perforation (a hole in the stomach wall), and gastric outlet obstruction. With proper treatment, most ulcers heal.",WHO recognizes H. pylori as a Class I carcinogen and a major cause of peptic ulcer disease and stomach cancer. They recommend testing and treating the infection in patients with ulcers.
Gastroenteritis,"An inflammation of the lining of the intestines caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasite. It is often called the ""stomach flu,"" though it is not related to influenza.",Viral gastroenteritis (caused by norovirus or rotavirus) is the most common cause. It spreads through contaminated food or water or contact with an infected person.,"Diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and cramps. Sometimes fever, headache, and muscle aches. Dehydration is the main complication.","Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, especially after using the toilet and before handling food. Disinfect contaminated surfaces. Avoid sharing personal items with someone who is sick.",A decoction of 15-20 tulsi leaves taken along with a pinch of rock salt (kala namak) helps in the cure.,Most cases of viral gastroenteritis are self-limiting and resolve within a few days. The primary goal of treatment is to stay hydrated. It can be very contagious.,"WHO focuses on preventing gastroenteritis through improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). For treatment, they strongly recommend Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) and continued feeding/breastfeeding to prevent dehydration, especially in children."
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD),"A digestive disorder that affects the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the ring of muscle between the esophagus and stomach. It causes stomach acid to frequently flow back into the esophagus.","GERD is caused by frequent acid reflux. Risk factors include obesity, hiatal hernia, pregnancy, and smoking. Certain foods and drinks can also trigger reflux.","The main symptom is frequent heartburn (a burning sensation in the chest). Other symptoms include regurgitation of food or sour liquid, difficulty swallowing, coughing, and a sensation of a lump in the throat.","Maintain a healthy weight. Avoid trigger foods like fatty or fried foods, caffeine, chocolate, and peppermint. Eat smaller meals and don't lie down for at least 3 hours after eating. Elevate the head of your bed.",DISCLAIMER: GERD should be managed with a doctor's guidance. The same lifestyle modifications listed under precautions are the primary home treatment. Over-the-counter antacids can provide temporary relief.,"GERD is a chronic condition. If not managed, long-term exposure to stomach acid can damage the esophagus, leading to complications like esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus, which increases the risk of esophageal cancer.","WHO's health promotion strategies that focus on healthy diets, weight management, and tobacco and alcohol reduction are all relevant for the prevention and management of GERD."
Genital Herpes,A common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Both can cause genital herpes.,"Caused by the herpes simplex virus, transmitted through sexual contact with someone who has the virus. The virus can be spread even when the infected person has no visible sores.","Many people have no symptoms. When they occur, they typically appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum, or mouth. These blisters break and leave painful sores that may take weeks to heal.","The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have sex. If sexually active, using condoms correctly every time can reduce the risk of transmission. Avoid sexual contact if you or your partner have an active outbreak.","DISCLAIMER: There is no cure for herpes, but a doctor can prescribe antiviral medications to help prevent or shorten outbreaks. For symptom relief during an outbreak, take warm baths, keep the affected area clean and dry, and wear loose-fitting cotton underwear.","Genital herpes is a lifelong infection. The virus remains dormant in the body and can reactivate, causing recurrent outbreaks. Antiviral medication can help manage the condition and reduce the risk of spreading it to a partner.","WHO's global strategy for STIs highlights the high prevalence of HSV. They work to raise awareness, promote condom use, and support research for better treatments and a potential vaccine."
Genital Warts,One of the most common types of sexually transmitted infections. They are soft growths that appear on the genitals.,Caused by certain low-risk strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is transmitted through sexual contact.,"Flesh-colored or gray swellings in the genital area. They can be single or multiple, small or large, and may be cauliflower-shaped. They can sometimes cause itching or discomfort.","The most effective precaution is the HPV vaccine, which protects against the HPV strains that cause most genital warts and cervical cancers. Using condoms can also reduce the risk of transmission.",DISCLAIMER: Genital warts should be diagnosed and treated by a doctor. Do not use over-the-counter wart removers. There are no proven home remedies to eliminate the warts. The virus may remain in the body even after warts are treated.,"While the warts can be removed with medical treatments (creams, cryotherapy, surgery), the underlying HPV infection may persist. The strains that cause genital warts are different from the high-risk strains that cause cancer.","WHO strongly recommends HPV vaccination for girls (and sometimes boys) as a primary prevention strategy against cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases, including genital warts."
Giddiness,"A general sensation of feeling dizzy, lightheaded, off-balance, or as if the room is spinning (vertigo).","Can be caused by a wide range of issues, including inner ear problems (like BPPV), dehydration, low blood sugar, anxiety, medication side effects, or heart and circulation problems.","Feeling unsteady, lightheaded, woozy, or experiencing a spinning sensation. May be accompanied by nausea or blurred vision.","If you feel giddy, sit or lie down immediately to avoid falling. Drink water. Avoid sudden changes in position. See a doctor to determine the underlying cause.",Soak cumin seeds (jeera) in lime juice overnight. Keep this mixture under the sun till completely dry. Bottle it. Chew Â½ teaspoon of this mixture and drink with a glass of warm water.,"Giddiness is a common symptom with many possible causes. While often temporary and benign, it can sometimes signal a serious underlying medical condition, so persistent or severe giddiness should be investigated.","WHO addresses giddiness within the context of diagnosing and managing its underlying causes, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, or nutritional deficiencies. A systematic approach to diagnosis is recommended."
Giddiness due to blood pressure,"Dizziness or lightheadedness caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure, most commonly upon standing up. This is known as orthostatic or postural hypotension.","When you stand up, gravity causes blood to pool in your legs. Normally, your body compensates. If it doesn't, blood pressure drops, reducing blood flow to the brain. Dehydration and certain medications can cause this.","A feeling of dizziness, lightheadedness, or even fainting that occurs within a few minutes of standing up from a sitting or lying position.","Stand up slowly. Stay well-hydrated. If prescribed, wear compression stockings. A doctor may need to adjust medications that could be contributing to the problem.","Soak 1 teaspoon each of powdered amla, coriander seeds (saboot dhania) and sandalwood in a cup of water overnight. Strain and drink the next day. Continue for a few days.","This is a common issue, especially among older adults. It increases the risk of falls and injuries. It's important to have it evaluated by a doctor to manage symptoms and rule out other causes.",WHO's guidelines on fall prevention in older adults recommend screening for postural hypotension. Management of high blood pressure also takes this potential side effect into account when choosing medications for elderly patients.
Glaucoma,"A group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, the health of which is vital for good vision. This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in your eye (intraocular pressure).","The most common form, open-angle glaucoma, is caused by the slow clogging of the eye's drainage canals, leading to increased eye pressure. The exact cause of the clogging is not known.","Open-angle glaucoma has no symptoms in its early stages. Gradually, it causes a loss of peripheral (side) vision. Angle-closure glaucoma has sudden, severe symptoms (see above).","There is no way to prevent glaucoma, but early detection and treatment can protect your vision. The only way to detect it early is through regular, comprehensive dilated eye exams.",DISCLAIMER: Glaucoma requires lifelong management by an ophthalmologist. There are no home treatments to cure it. The key is to use your prescribed eye drops exactly as directed to control eye pressure.,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The vision loss is gradual and often goes unnoticed until it is advanced. This is why regular eye exams are so important, especially for those with risk factors.","WHO's ""World Report on Vision"" identifies glaucoma as a major cause of preventable blindness. They advocate for integrating eye health into primary care to improve early detection and referral for treatment."
Goiter,"An abnormal enlargement of your thyroid gland, which is the butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of your neck.","The most common cause worldwide is a lack of iodine in the diet. In countries where iodized salt is common, goiter is more often due to other causes, like Hashimoto's disease, Graves' disease, or nodules on the thyroid.","The primary sign is a visible swelling at the base of the neck. A large goiter can cause a tight feeling in the throat, coughing, hoarseness, and difficulty swallowing or breathing.","In many parts of the world, using iodized salt is the most important precaution to prevent goiter caused by iodine deficiency.",DISCLAIMER: Any swelling in the neck should be evaluated by a doctor to determine the cause. Treatment depends on the cause and size. Home care is not a substitute for medical evaluation. Consuming iodine-rich foods (like seafood and dairy) or using iodized salt is important if the cause is iodine deficiency.,"A goiter itself is not necessarily harmful, and small goiters that don't cause symptoms may not need treatment. However, it can be a sign of an underlying thyroid disease that does require treatment.",WHO has led global efforts to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders by promoting universal salt iodization. This simple public health measure has dramatically reduced the incidence of goiter in many countries.
Golden Rules for Gas Patients,"A set of lifestyle and dietary recommendations to help manage and reduce symptoms of excess intestinal gas, bloating, and flatulence.",(Not a disease) This is a management strategy for the condition of 'Gas Problem' or 'Flatulence'.,"(Not a disease) This aims to alleviate symptoms like bloating, abdominal discomfort, belching, and excessive flatulence.","Eat and drink slowly. Chew food thoroughly. Avoid carbonated drinks and chewing gum. Identify and limit personal food triggers (e.g., beans, lentils, broccoli, onions). Incorporate regular physical activity.","Avoid heavy (fried), spicy food. Do not eat very large meals, instead eat small meals. Try to eat a little, every 2 hours, so that the gap between the meals is not too big. Do some exercise. Even a walk will do wonders.","Managing gas is often a matter of trial and error to find out what works for you. These rules provide a starting point for most people. If symptoms are severe, consult a doctor.","WHO promotes a healthy, balanced diet. While some healthy foods (like legumes and certain vegetables) can produce gas, their nutritional benefits are vital. The guidance is to consume them as part of a balanced diet, perhaps introducing them gradually."
Gonorrhea,A common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.,"Transmitted through sexual contact (vaginal, anal, or oral sex) with an infected person. It can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth.","Many people have no symptoms. In men, symptoms can include a burning sensation when urinating and a white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis. In women, symptoms are often mild and can include painful urination and vaginal discharge.","Abstinence, a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a tested partner, and consistent and correct condom use are the most effective precautions.",DISCLAIMER: Gonorrhea requires a medical diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics for both you and your partner. There are NO home treatments to cure the infection.,"If left untreated, gonorrhea can cause serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility in women, and epididymitis and infertility in men. It can also spread to the blood and joints. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem.","WHO is concerned about the rise of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea. Their global action plan focuses on surveillance to track resistance patterns, promoting prevention through safe sex practices, and supporting research for new treatment options."
Gouty Pains,"The severe pain associated with gout, a common and complex form of inflammatory arthritis. It's characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, and redness in the joints.","Caused by hyperuricemia, a condition where there is too much uric acid in the blood. The uric acid can form sharp, needle-like crystals in a joint, triggering an inflammatory response.","An intense, sudden joint pain, often affecting the big toe at night. The affected joint is swollen, tender, warm, and red.","Maintain a healthy weight, limit purine-rich foods (red meat, organ meats, certain seafood), limit alcohol (especially beer), and stay well-hydrated with water.",Mix mustard oil and rectified alcohol (1 part oil to 40 parts alcohol) and use as a lotion. Make a poultice of ground fenugreek seeds (methi dana); use on the affected part.,Gout is not just a sore toe; it's a painful form of arthritis that can cause permanent joint damage if not managed. It is highly treatable with medication and lifestyle changes.,WHO classifies gout under musculoskeletal conditions. Guidelines focus on managing acute attacks with anti-inflammatory drugs and long-term prevention with uric acid-lowering medications and lifestyle modifications.
Gravesâ Disease,An autoimmune disorder that leads to an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).,"The immune system produces an antibody that mimics thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), causing the thyroid gland to produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones. The cause is likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors.","Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include anxiety, irritability, tremor in the hands, heat sensitivity, weight loss, bulging eyes (Graves' ophthalmopathy), and a rapid or irregular heartbeat.","The cause is not known, so prevention is not possible.","DISCLAIMER: Graves' disease requires medical treatment from an endocrinologist. Home care is supportive. Managing stress, as it can trigger or worsen symptoms. Eating a healthy diet and getting enough calcium and vitamin D to protect bone health. Using cool compresses for eye discomfort.","Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. If left untreated, it can lead to serious heart problems, brittle bones, and, in rare cases, a life-threatening complication called a thyroid storm.","WHO does not have specific guidelines for Graves' disease, but it falls under their work on non-communicable diseases. They support strengthening health systems to manage chronic endocrine disorders."
Guidelines of a Diabetics Diet,"A structured eating plan designed to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels, manage their weight, and control risk factors for complications.",(Not a disease) This is a key component of managing the condition 'Diabetes'.,(Not a disease) This aims to control symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and prevent long-term complications of diabetes.,"Focus on a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. Control portion sizes. Monitor carbohydrate intake. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated fats.","Eat plenty of vegetables like lettuce (salaad patta), tomato and fruits. Use the following fruits and vegetables sparingly and with caution: banana, seedless grapes (angoor), cheeku, leechi, custard apple (sharifa), dry fruits, mango, raisins (kishmish), potatoes, jackfruit (kathal), carrots (gajar), peas (mattar), beans, sweet potato (shakarkandi), beetroot (chukandar). Foods rich in fibre should be preferred. Daily intake of calories should be restricted.Use proteins moderately. Milk & nuts intake to be restricted to the minimum whereas have plenty of curds and buttermilk (chhach). Avoid all refined foods & sweets. Drink 8-10 glasses of water daily.","There is no single ""diabetes diet."" The plan should be individualized. Working with a registered dietitian or a diabetes educator is crucial to creating a sustainable and effective eating plan.",WHO strongly recommends diet and lifestyle modification as a cornerstone of diabetes management and prevention. Their guidelines emphasize reducing intake of sugar and unhealthy fats and increasing consumption of fiber and whole grains.
Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome,A rare but serious autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy nerve cells in the peripheral nervous system.,The exact cause is unknown. It often develops a few days or weeks after a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral or bacterial infection. The infection seems to trigger the abnormal immune response.,"The classic symptom is weakness and tingling in the feet and legs that spreads to the upper body. It can progress to paralysis. In severe cases, it can affect breathing.","As the trigger is often a common infection, there is no known way to prevent GBS.","DISCLAIMER: GBS is a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization, often in an intensive care unit, to monitor breathing. There are NO home treatments.","GBS can be a devastating disorder because of its sudden onset and rapid progression. However, most people make a good recovery, although it can be slow and some may have residual weakness. Treatment involves therapies to reduce the immune attack on the nerves.","WHO monitors outbreaks of infectious diseases, like Zika virus, that have been linked to an increased incidence of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. They provide guidance to countries on surveillance and clinical management of the syndrome."
Hair Dullness And Coarseness,"A cosmetic condition where hair lacks shine and has a rough, dry texture.","Over-processing with chemical treatments (dyeing, bleaching), excessive heat styling, using harsh hair products, nutritional deficiencies, and environmental factors like sun exposure.","Hair appears lackluster, feels rough or straw-like to the touch, and is often prone to tangling and frizz.","Use gentle, moisturizing shampoos and conditioners. Limit heat styling. Use a heat protectant spray. Get regular trims. Eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals.",Grind fresh fenugreek leaves (methi) to a paste and apply the leaf paste over the scalp before a bath.,"Dull, coarse hair is often a sign of damage to the outer layer (cuticle) of the hair shaft. Restoring moisture and avoiding further damage are key to improving its appearance.",WHO does not provide guidelines on cosmetic hair conditions. General health recommendations from WHO on balanced nutrition can contribute to healthy hair growth.
Hair Falling,"Excessive shedding of hair from the scalp. It's normal to lose some hair each day, but significant shedding can lead to thinning.","Common causes include physical or emotional stress (telogen effluvium), hormonal changes (postpartum, menopause), nutritional deficiencies, certain illnesses, and medications.","Noticing a larger than usual amount of hair on a hairbrush, in the shower drain, or on a pillow. A general thinning of hair volume may be observed.","Eat a balanced diet rich in protein, iron, and vitamins. Manage stress effectively. Handle hair gently, avoiding tight hairstyles and harsh treatments.","Take a handful of neem leaves and boil them in 4 cups water. After cooling and filtering, use the decoction for rinsing hair. Mix equal quantities of dried curry leaves (curry patta), lime peel (nimbu ka chilka), Shikakai, fenugreek seeds (methi daana) & green gram (moong saboot) and grind them finely. Store and use as a substitute for soap or shampoo. Apply fenugreek (methi) seeds, ground with some water and the paste on the head. Allow to soak at least for 40 minutes before washing. Use every morning for a month.","Most cases of excessive shedding are temporary and hair growth returns to normal once the underlying cause is resolved. If shedding is persistent, it's wise to see a doctor or dermatologist.","WHO addresses hair loss primarily as a side effect of certain medical treatments (like chemotherapy) or as a symptom of nutritional deficiencies (like iron deficiency anemia), for which they have clear management guidelines."
Hair Greying,The process by which hair loses its natural pigment (melanin) and turns grey or white.,"Primarily caused by the natural aging process, as the pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) in the hair follicles become less active. Genetics play a major role in determining when this starts. Stress and certain medical conditions can also contribute.","The appearance of individual strands of white or grey hair, which gradually increases over time until most or all of the hair is affected.","Greying is a natural, irreversible process. There is no way to prevent it. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and managing stress may help support overall hair health.","Wet a lemon half and rub lemon juice into the scalp well. Wash off after it turns dry. Grind 1 tablespoon each, pulp of amla and lime juice. Massage this into the hair before going to bed. Wash it next morning. Soak shredded ginger (adrak) in honey. Eat a spoonful every morning.",The age at which hair starts to grey is largely determined by your genes. It is not a medical problem. Premature greying can sometimes be linked to specific health issues and warrants a check-up.,WHO does not issue guidelines on hair greying as it is a natural part of aging and not a disease state.
Hair Loss,A noticeable thinning of hair or the appearance of bald spots. Medically known as alopecia.,"The most common cause is hereditary male- or female-pattern baldness. Other causes include hormonal changes, medical conditions (like thyroid disease, alopecia areata), medications, and severe stress.","Gradual thinning on the top of the head, a receding hairline, circular or patchy bald spots, or sudden loosening and shedding of hair.","Some forms are not preventable (hereditary). For others, eating a healthy diet, managing stress, and treating underlying medical conditions can help. Protect the scalp from the sun.",Apply a little almond oil (badam ka tel) on scalp frequently and massage.,"Hair loss can have a significant psychological impact. It's important to get a proper diagnosis from a dermatologist, as there are many different types and causes, and some are treatable.","WHO addresses hair loss in the context of specific underlying causes, such as infectious diseases (e.g., fungal infections of the scalp) or nutritional deficiencies, rather than addressing cosmetic or hereditary hair loss directly."
Hair Thinning,"A gradual decrease in the density and volume of hair over time, making the scalp more visible.","Can be a part of the natural aging process, hereditary hair loss, hormonal fluctuations, nutritional deficiencies (especially iron and protein), or a side effect of stress or illness.","A widening part line, less overall hair volume, or a smaller ponytail are common signs. It is often a more diffuse process than patchy hair loss.","Ensure a diet rich in protein, iron, zinc, and vitamins. Manage stress. Use gentle hair care practices. Consult a doctor to rule out and treat any underlying medical issues.",Bathe the hair in 1 cup coconut milk twice or thrice a week for a few months.,"Hair thinning is a very common concern for both men and women. Early intervention can sometimes slow the process or improve hair density, so seeking professional advice is beneficial.","WHO's focus is on health conditions. While they don't have guidelines for hair thinning itself, their recommendations on nutrition and managing chronic diseases are relevant as these can be underlying causes."
Halitosis (Bad Breath),"A persistent, unpleasant odor in exhaled breath.","The most common cause (in about 90% of cases) is poor oral hygiene. Bacteria on the tongue and between teeth break down food particles, releasing smelly sulfur compounds. Other causes include dry mouth, smoking, certain foods, and medical conditions like gum disease or sinus infections.",An unpleasant odor from the mouth that is noticeable to others.,"Practice good oral hygiene: brush your teeth and tongue twice a day, floss daily, and see your dentist regularly for check-ups and cleanings.

It is common in areas with poor sanitation.","Symptoms can include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, low-grade fever, dark urine, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Young children often have no symptoms.","The most effective precaution is the hepatitis A vaccine. Practicing good hygiene, including thorough handwashing after using the toilet and before handling food, and consuming safe food and water are also crucial.","DISCLAIMER: There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. The body will clear the virus on its own. Home care focuses on rest, managing nausea, and maintaining adequate nutrition and hydration. Avoid alcohol to let the liver heal.","Hepatitis A does not cause chronic liver disease, and infection provides lifelong immunity. While most people recover fully, it can cause a severe illness that requires hospitalization and, in rare cases, can be fatal.","WHO strongly recommends the hepatitis A vaccine be integrated into routine childhood immunization schedules in countries with high rates of infection. They also promote improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) as a key prevention strategy."
Hepatitis B,"A potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can be both an acute illness and a chronic, lifelong infection.","The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. Common modes of transmission include sexual contact, sharing needles, and from an infected mother to her baby at birth.","Many people have no symptoms during the acute infection. When they occur, they are similar to Hepatitis A (fatigue, jaundice). Chronic infection also may not cause symptoms for decades, until the liver is severely damaged.","The most effective precaution is the hepatitis B vaccine. Practicing safe sex, not sharing needles or personal items like razors, and screening pregnant women are other key measures.","DISCLAIMER: Chronic hepatitis B requires lifelong monitoring and management by a doctor. Antiviral medications can help control the virus. Home care involves protecting your liver: avoid alcohol, eat a healthy diet, and check with your doctor before taking any new medications or supplements.","Chronic hepatitis B is a major cause of serious liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. While there is no cure for the chronic infection, treatment can control the virus and reduce the risk of complications.","WHO's global strategy for eliminating viral hepatitis has a major focus on hepatitis B. Key pillars are universal infant vaccination, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, blood and injection safety, and increasing access to testing and treatment."
Hepatitis C,"A liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is primarily a blood-borne virus. For some people, hepatitis C is a short-term illness, but for most, it becomes a long-term, chronic infection.","The virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to small quantities of blood. This may happen through injection drug use, unsafe healthcare practices, or the transfusion of unscreened blood. Sexual transmission is less common.","Most people with acute or chronic hepatitis C have no symptoms. If they do occur, they are often mild and nonspecific, like fatigue. Many people don't know they are infected until they develop liver damage decades later.",There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. Prevention relies on reducing the risk of exposure. This includes not sharing needles or injection equipment and ensuring that medical procedures are performed with sterile equipment.,DISCLAIMER: Hepatitis C is now a curable disease with highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medications.

The development of DAA medications has revolutionized treatment, offering a cure to over 95% of people. The challenge is getting people tested and linked to care.","WHO's global strategy aims to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030, with a major focus on hepatitis C. Their strategy involves scaling up testing to find the millions of undiagnosed people and ensuring access to affordable, curative DAA treatments."
Hernia,"A general term for when an organ pushes through an opening in the muscle or tissue that holds it in place. The most common types are abdominal hernias (inguinal, femoral, umbilical, incisional).",Caused by a combination of muscle weakness and strain. Anything that causes increased pressure in the abdomen can contribute to a hernia.,"The most common symptom is a bulge or lump in the affected area. There may be pain or discomfort, especially when coughing, bending over, or lifting something heavy.","Maintain a healthy weight, eat a high-fiber diet to prevent straining, lift heavy objects properly, and don't smoke (to prevent chronic coughing).",DISCLAIMER: A hernia requires medical evaluation. Home care cannot cure it. Avoiding heavy lifting and straining can prevent it from worsening. Wearing a supportive garment like a truss may provide temporary comfort but is not a long-term solution.,"Hernias do not heal on their own and usually require surgery to repair. A strangulated hernia, where the blood supply is cut off, is a medical emergency.","WHO includes hernia repair as an essential surgical procedure, working to improve access to safe and affordable surgery worldwide, which is critical for preventing the life-threatening complications of untreated hernias."
Herpes Simplex Virus Infection,"Infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-1 typically causes oral herpes (cold sores), and HSV-2 typically causes genital herpes, but both viruses can infect either area.",The virus is transmitted through direct contact with sores or sometimes with the skin of an infected person even when no sores are visible (asymptomatic shedding).,Symptoms are characterized by blisters or ulcers at the infection site. Oral herpes: sores around the mouth or on the face. Genital herpes: sores on or around the genitals. Many people have very mild or no symptoms.,"Avoid direct contact (like kissing or sexual contact) with someone who has an active outbreak. Using condoms can reduce but not eliminate the risk of genital transmission. Don't share items that touch the mouth, like utensils or lip balm.","DISCLAIMER: There is no cure for herpes. Antiviral medications can shorten and prevent outbreaks. For an outbreak, keeping the area clean and dry can help healing. Applying a cool compress may offer some relief.",HSV is a lifelong infection. The virus stays dormant in the nerve cells and can reactivate periodically. It is an extremely common infection worldwide.,"WHO tracks the global prevalence of HSV infections. Their strategy focuses on promoting awareness, encouraging safe sexual practices to prevent genital herpes, and supporting research for better treatments and a preventative vaccine."
Hiatal Hernia,A condition in which the upper part of your stomach bulges through the large muscle separating your abdomen and chest (diaphragm).,"The exact cause is often not known. It may be caused by increased pressure in the abdomen from things like coughing, straining, or heavy lifting, combined with a weakening of the diaphragm muscle. Age and obesity are risk factors.","Most small hiatal hernias cause no problems. Larger ones can allow food and acid to back up into the esophagus, causing symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn, regurgitation, and chest pain.","Maintain a healthy weight, avoid straining during bowel movements, and get help with heavy lifting.","DISCLAIMER: Medical treatment is usually only needed if it causes severe GERD. Home care is focused on managing reflux symptoms. Eat smaller, more frequent meals, avoid trigger foods, don't lie down after eating, and elevate the head of your bed.","A hiatal hernia itself rarely requires treatment. The focus is on managing the symptoms of acid reflux it may cause. In rare cases, very large hernias may require surgical repair.",WHO's health promotion messages about maintaining a healthy weight and diet for preventing non-communicable diseases are also relevant for reducing the risk and symptoms associated with hiatal hernias.
Hiccups,"Involuntary contractions (spasms) of the diaphragm muscle. Each contraction is followed by a sudden closure of your vocal cords, which produces the characteristic ""hic"" sound.","Common triggers include eating a large meal, drinking alcoholic or carbonated beverages, sudden excitement or emotional stress, or swallowing air. They are rarely a sign of an underlying medical problem.","The repeated, uncontrollable ""hic"" sound.","There is no certain way to stop them, but common home remedies include holding your breath, drinking a glass of cold water quickly, or swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. They usually go away on their own.","Drink Â½ glass water, slowly. w Keep a teaspoon of sugar in your month and suck slowly. Swallow Â½ teaspoon mustard seeds (sarson) mixed with Â½ teaspoon pure ghee. Grind 4 cardamom (chhoti illaichi) well. Boil it in 2Â½ cups or Â½ litre water. When about 1 cup water remains, remove from fire and sieve it through a muslin cloth. Let it cool. When warm, drink a glassful. Works like magic. Suck 2-3 small pieces of fresh ginger (adrak). This helps in hiccups which keep occurring again and again.","Hiccups are a common, harmless reflex. While annoying, they are almost always temporary. Hiccups that last for more than 48 hours (persistent hiccups) should be evaluated by a doctor as they can signal an underlying condition.","WHO does not provide guidelines for hiccups as they are a benign, self-limiting reflex and not a public health concern."
High Blood Pressure,"A common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. Also known as hypertension.","The exact causes are often not known, but it's linked to genetics, age, and lifestyle factors like a high-salt diet, lack of exercise, obesity, excessive alcohol, and stress.","Hypertension is often called the ""silent killer"" because it typically has no signs or symptoms. The only way to know if you have it is to get your blood pressure checked regularly.","Eat a heart-healthy, low-salt diet. Get regular physical activity. Maintain a healthy weight. Limit alcohol. Don't smoke. Manage stress. Take prescribed medications as directed.","Restrict salt intake and drink plenty of fluids (at least 8-10 glasses of water daily) Drink curry leaves (curry patta) juice initially 3 times a day (1 glassful) for 1- 2 months and then reduce to only once in the morning. Have it on empty stomach. For taking out juice: fill your mixy with washed curry leaves, add Â½3/4 glass water. Churn well and sieve. Add Â½ - 1 lemon juice and drink fresh. Have single pod garlic (lasan), one pod first thing every morning or if this is not available, have 1-2 cloves of ordinary garlic (lasan). If you get discomfort with having garlic first thing in the morning, have 2 cloves twice a day - swallow with water any time or with meals. Mix 1 teaspoon honey, 1 teaspoon ginger (adrak) juice, 1 teaspoon cumin (jeera) powder. Have twice a day. Go on an apple diet for a few days. It has a diuretic effect and thus brings down the B.P. Fruits such as mausami, orange, peaches (aaru), plum (aloo bukhara), watermelon (tarbooz) are also beneficial. Having rice, particularly brown rice as the main staple food is very beneficial. As rice has very low sodium content and low cholesterol, it is a perfect diet for those who have been advised to have low salt diets. Consumption of natural diuretics like coconut water, butter milk, coriander (dhania) juice (make from green coriander in the same way as curry leaves juice) is very beneficial. Last but not the least, rest, relaxation and good sleep are effective in keeping B.P. under control. Drink coriander (dhania) juice made from fresh dhania (same way as curry leaves juices) 3 times a day. If this is not effective, start having fenugreek (methi) juice instead (made from fresh methi) and if this is also not effective, move to curry leaves juice. Drink each juice for 10-12 days at least before you decide. If it is not working and then move to the next one.","High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease. It's a very common and manageable condition.

Their HEARTS technical package provides a strategic approach for countries to improve cardiovascular health, with a key focus on hypertension detection, treatment, and control at the primary care level."
High Cholesterol,A condition where you have too much of a waxy substance called cholesterol in your blood. High cholesterol can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries (atherosclerosis).,"Caused by a combination of genetics and lifestyle choices. An unhealthy diet high in saturated and trans fats, lack of physical activity, and smoking are major contributors.",There are no symptoms. A blood test is the only way to detect high cholesterol.,"Eat a diet low in saturated and trans fats. Choose lean meats, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Exercise regularly. Maintain a healthy weight. Don't smoke.",Finely dice an onion and mix it with 1 cup buttermilk along with Â¼ teaspoon black pepper (kali mirch) powder and drink. Regularly intake garlic (lasan) cloves for a few days. Regularly intake coriander (dhania) decoction made by boiling 2 teaspoon dry seed powder in 1 cup water. (Milk and sugar can be added to improve its taste. This could be a welcome substitute for tea or coffee.),"High cholesterol significantly increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. It is a manageable condition. Lifestyle changes are the first line of defense, but many people also require medication (like statins).","WHO guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease strongly emphasize the management of cholesterol levels through diet, physical activity, and pharmacological therapy when necessary. It is a key target in reducing the global burden of NCDs."
HIV/AIDS,"HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), the most advanced stage of the infection.","HIV is spread through certain body fluids from an infected person, including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, and breast milk. The most common modes of transmission are unprotected sex and sharing injection drug equipment.","Early symptoms can be flu-like (fever, rash, sore throat) a few weeks after infection. After this, the virus can be asymptomatic for years. As the immune system weakens, people can develop opportunistic infections and cancers, which defines AIDS.","Use condoms correctly every time you have sex. Do not share needles. If you are at high risk, consider pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Pregnant women with HIV should receive treatment to prevent passing the virus to their baby.","DISCLAIMER: HIV requires lifelong medical treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART). There is no cure. Home care involves strict adherence to the medication schedule, eating a healthy diet to support the immune system, practicing safe sex to prevent transmission, and managing any side effects of the medication with your doctor.","With effective ART, people with HIV can live long, healthy lives and will not develop AIDS. Treatment can also reduce the amount of virus in the body to an undetectable level, which means they cannot transmit the virus to a sexual partner (Undetectable = Untransmittable).","WHO leads the global health sector response to HIV. Their strategy focuses on prevention (condoms, PrEP), scaling up testing to ensure everyone knows their status, and ensuring universal access to quality antiretroviral therapy and care."
Hodgkinâs Lymphoma,"A type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's germ-fighting immune system. It is distinguished by the presence of specific abnormal cells called Reed-Sternberg cells.","The exact cause is unknown, but risk factors include infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a weakened immune system (like from HIV), a family history of the disease, and being in a certain age group (early adulthood or after age 55).","Painless swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin; persistent fatigue; fever; night sweats; unexplained weight loss; severe itching; increased sensitivity to the effects of alcohol or pain in lymph nodes after drinking alcohol.","There is no known way to prevent Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding known risk factors, such as HIV infection, may lower the risk. Early detection through awareness of symptoms is key.","*Disclaimer: Medical treatment is essential and should not be replaced with home remedies.* Home care focuses on managing the side effects of treatment: maintain a balanced diet to stay strong, get adequate rest to combat fatigue, practice stress-reduction techniques like meditation, and use moisturizers for itchy skin.","Hodgkin's lymphoma is one of the most curable forms of cancer, especially when diagnosed and treated early. Awareness of the symptoms, particularly persistent swollen lymph nodes, is crucial for early diagnosis.","WHO includes lymphomas in its global cancer control strategies, promoting early diagnosis, affordable and accessible treatment, and palliative care. It emphasizes strengthening health systems to manage cancers effectively in all countries."
Hyperthyroidism,A condition in which the thyroid gland is overactive and produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones (thyroxine). This condition accelerates the body's metabolism significantly.,"The most common cause is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder. Other causes include overactive thyroid nodules (toxic adenoma), thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland), or consuming too much iodine.","Unintentional weight loss despite an increased appetite, rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations), nervousness, anxiety, irritability, hand tremors, sweating, changes in menstrual patterns, and sensitivity to heat.","Avoid smoking, as it is a significant risk factor for Graves' disease. Manage stress and avoid excessive iodine intake from foods or supplements unless directed by a doctor. Regular check-ups are important for those with risk factors.","*Disclaimer: This condition requires medical diagnosis and treatment.* To support medical treatment, focus on a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D to protect bones. Avoid caffeine and other stimulants that can worsen symptoms like anxiety and rapid heart rate. Selenium-rich foods like Brazil nuts may support thyroid health.","It's a manageable condition, but if left untreated, it can lead to serious heart problems, bone loss, and a dangerous condition called thyroid storm. Awareness of symptoms like unexplained weight loss and anxiety can lead to early diagnosis.","WHO addresses thyroid disorders as part of its management of noncommunicable diseases. It supports universal salt iodization programs, which are crucial for preventing iodine deficiency disorders, while also monitoring for iodine excess."
Hypoglycemia,"A condition characterized by an abnormally low level of blood sugar (glucose), the body's primary source of energy. It is most often seen in people with diabetes who are using insulin or other diabetes medications.","In people with diabetes, causes include taking too much insulin or medication, skipping a meal, or exercising more than usual. In non-diabetics, causes can include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, critical illnesses, or tumors.","Shakiness, dizziness, sweating, hunger, fast heartbeat, irritability or moodiness, anxiety, confusion, headache, and blurred vision. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures and loss of consciousness.","For diabetics, regularly monitoring blood sugar, eating regular meals and snacks, and adjusting medication and exercise plans with a doctor is crucial. For non-diabetics, eating small, frequent meals with a mix of carbohydrates, protein, and fat can help.","The standard immediate treatment is the '15-15 rule': consume 15 grams of a fast-acting carbohydrate (like fruit juice, glucose tablets, or hard candy), wait 15 minutes, and then recheck blood sugar levels. Repeat if it's still low. Once levels normalize, eat a small snack with protein and carbs to prevent another drop.",Hypoglycemia can be a medical emergency. People with diabetes and their families should be educated on recognizing the symptoms and how to treat them quickly. Carrying a source of fast-acting sugar is essential for at-risk individuals.,"WHO's guidelines on diabetes management heavily emphasize the prevention, recognition, and management of hypoglycemia. Patient education on self-monitoring of blood glucose and symptom awareness is a core recommendation."
Hypothyroidism,A condition where the thyroid gland is underactive and doesn't produce enough crucial thyroid hormones. This slows down the body's metabolism.,"The most common cause is Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid. Other causes include radiation therapy to the neck, thyroid surgery, certain medications, and iodine deficiency.","Fatigue, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, dry skin, weight gain, puffy face, hoarseness, muscle weakness, elevated blood cholesterol level, thinning hair, and depression.","While often not preventable, avoiding excessive intake of goitrogens (in raw cruciferous vegetables) for those with iodine deficiency may help. Ensure adequate, but not excessive, iodine intake. Regular check-ups are important.","*Disclaimer: Medical treatment with hormone replacement is necessary.* To support treatment, a diet rich in iodine (iodized salt, seafood), selenium (Brazil nuts, fish), and zinc (oysters, beef) is beneficial. Avoid processed foods and maintain a regular, gentle exercise routine to combat fatigue and aid metabolism.","It is a common and highly treatable condition. Many symptoms are non-specific and can be mistaken for other conditions, so awareness is key for diagnosis. Lifelong medication is often required to manage the condition effectively.","WHO focuses on preventing iodine deficiency, a leading cause of hypothyroidism globally, through its universal salt iodization programs. This has dramatically reduced the incidence of conditions like goiter and cretinism."
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF),"A chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by scarring (fibrosis) of the lung tissue. 'Idiopathic' means the cause is unknown. The scarring makes the lungs thick and stiff, making it difficult to breathe.","The cause is unknown. Risk factors include cigarette smoking, certain viral infections, exposure to environmental pollutants (like dust from wood, metal, or stone), and a family history of the disease. It typically affects older adults.","Shortness of breath (especially during physical activity), a dry, hacking cough that doesn't go away, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and clubbing (widening and rounding) of the tips of the fingers or toes.",Avoiding smoking is the most significant preventive step. Minimizing exposure to occupational and environmental dust and fumes is also recommended. Early diagnosis is crucial to manage the disease and slow its progression.,"*Disclaimer: Medical treatment is essential to manage symptoms.* Home care involves energy conservation techniques, using supplemental oxygen as prescribed, and practicing breathing exercises (pursed-lip breathing) to improve efficiency. Eating small, frequent, nutrient-dense meals can help combat weight loss and fatigue.","IPF is a serious, life-limiting disease. Awareness is focused on the importance of early diagnosis, as treatments are more effective at slowing the disease's progression when started early. Support groups are vital for patients and caregivers.",WHO classifies IPF under interstitial lung diseases. It promotes research and supports policies aimed at reducing exposure to risk factors like tobacco smoke and air pollution as part of its strategy against chronic respiratory diseases.
Impetigo,"A highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects infants and children. It usually appears as reddish sores on the face, especially around the nose and mouth, and on the hands and feet. The sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts.","It's caused by bacteria, most often Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacteria can enter the body through a cut, insect bite, or other injury to the skin, but it can also develop on healthy skin.","Red sores that quickly rupture, ooze for a few days, and then form a yellowish-brown crust. The sores are often itchy but not painful. A more serious form can cause large, painful, fluid-filled blisters.","Good hygiene is the best prevention. Wash hands, cuts, scrapes, and insect bites with soap and water. Avoid sharing personal items like towels or razors. Keep fingernails short to prevent scratching from spreading the infection.","*Disclaimer: Medical advice and often prescription antibiotics are needed.* For minor cases, gently washing the sores with soap and water to remove crusts can help. Applying a non-prescription antibiotic ointment may be suggested by a doctor. Keep the area clean and covered with a light bandage.","Awareness is key to preventing its spread, especially in schools and daycares. It's important to know that it's contagious until the sores heal or after 24-48 hours of antibiotic treatment. Children should stay home from school until no longer contagious.","WHO addresses skin infections like impetigo as part of its programs on integrated management of childhood illness and skin-related neglected tropical diseases, emphasizing hygiene, sanitation, and access to basic healthcare and antibiotics."
Indigestion,"A general term for discomfort or pain in the upper abdomen, often occurring after eating. It is a symptom, not a disease. Also known as dyspepsia.","Commonly caused by overeating, eating too quickly, or consuming fatty, greasy, or spicy foods. It can also be triggered by stress, smoking, alcohol, or be a symptom of an underlying problem like GERD or ulcers.","Symptoms include a feeling of fullness during a meal, uncomfortable fullness after a meal, burning or pain in the upper abdomen, and bloating.","Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid trigger foods. Chew your food slowly and completely. Manage stress. Reduce caffeine and alcohol intake.","20 ml. decoction prepared from 5 gm. coarse powder with a pinch of ginger powder thrice a day.5-10 ml. juice twice or thrice daily.A pinch of powder with a piece of cru sh ed ginger & rock salt should be taken before meal.2gm. powder with guda twice daily before meal.5-10 ml. juice of fruit twice daily.10 ml. juice of fruit, 1 gm. blacksalt or fried Jira powder with honey or sugar to hold inside m ou th for so m etim e b efo re food.2 gm. powder of bark with water twice a day.3-5 gm. powder with powder of fried Jeera and rock-salt with warm water thrice daily.1-2 gm. powder with warm water.5-6 gm. powder of fried Jeera and rock-salt with warm water thrice daily.5 gm. crushed rhizome with salt or jaggery twice daily before meal.5-10 ml. juice with a pinch of salt and pepper before food. not every remedy is necessary to for relif you can try any of it.","Occasional indigestion is very common and usually not a cause for concern. However, if it is persistent or accompanied by severe pain, weight loss, or difficulty swallowing, you should see a doctor.",WHO does not have specific guidelines for indigestion itself but addresses its common underlying causes like GERD or H. pylori infection. General dietary advice promotes healthy eating patterns which can prevent indigestion.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),An umbrella term used to describe chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The two main types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.,"The exact cause is unknown but is believed to result from a faulty immune system response to environmental triggers in genetically predisposed individuals. It is not caused by stress or diet, though these can trigger flare-ups.","Persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or bloody stools, weight loss, and fatigue. The symptoms can vary depending on the location and severity of inflammation.","There's no known prevention. However, managing the disease involves avoiding triggers that can cause a flare-up. This includes managing stress, quitting smoking (a major risk factor for Crohn's disease), and avoiding certain medications like NSAIDs if they worsen symptoms.","*Disclaimer: Medical treatment is essential.* During flare-ups, a low-residue or low-fiber diet may help reduce symptoms. Keeping a food diary can identify personal trigger foods. Probiotics may help some individuals. Stress management techniques like yoga and meditation are beneficial.","IBD is a chronic, lifelong condition with periods of remission and relapse. It is different from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Awareness helps reduce stigma and emphasizes that it's a serious autoimmune disease, not just a sensitive stomach.",WHO recognizes IBD as a significant noncommunicable digestive disease that impacts quality of life. It supports research into causes and effective treatments and works to integrate digestive health into broader public health strategies.
Influenza (Flu),"A contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death.","Caused by influenza viruses (Type A, B, and C). It spreads through respiratory droplets when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk. You can also get it by touching a surface with the virus on it and then touching your own mouth, nose, or eyes.","Sudden onset of fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children.","The single best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine each year. Other important measures include frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and staying away from people who are sick.","*Disclaimer: Seek medical care for severe symptoms.* Rest and hydration are crucial. Drink plenty of water, juice, and warm soup to prevent dehydration. Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve symptoms like fever and aches. A humidifier may ease a cough and sore throat.","The flu is more dangerous than the common cold for many people, especially high-risk groups like young children, older adults, and those with chronic health conditions. Annual vaccination is the most effective public health measure to prevent severe outcomes.","WHO's Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide, provides guidance to countries for surveillance and response, and makes recommendations on the composition of the seasonal flu vaccine twice a year."
Insomnia,"A common sleep disorder characterized by persistent difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing non-restorative sleep, despite having the opportunity for it. This leads to daytime impairment.","Causes are varied and include psychological stress, anxiety, depression, poor sleep habits (e.g., irregular schedule, stimulating activities before bed), certain medical conditions (like chronic pain or hyperthyroidism), and medications.","Difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep (waking up often), waking up too early and not being able to get back to sleep, and feeling tired or not well-rested upon waking.","Establish a regular sleep schedule (go to bed and wake up at the same time every day). Create a relaxing bedtime routine. Make your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and large meals close to bedtime. Get regular physical activity during the day.","*Disclaimer: Consult a doctor if insomnia is chronic.* Relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can be helpful. A warm bath before bed can promote sleepiness. Herbal teas like chamomile or valerian root are traditionally used, but consult a doctor before trying supplements.","Insomnia is a real medical condition, not just a minor inconvenience. It can have serious impacts on mental and physical health, increasing the risk of accidents and chronic diseases. Good sleep hygiene is the first line of defense.","WHO recognizes sleep health as a critical component of overall health and well-being. It highlights the global burden of sleep disorders and promotes public health policies that address factors contributing to poor sleep, such as stress and work-life balance."
Interstitial Cystitis (IC) / Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS),"A chronic condition causing bladder pressure, bladder pain, and sometimes pelvic pain. The pain ranges from mild discomfort to severe. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other conditions are ruled out first.","The exact cause is unknown. Theories include a defect in the bladder lining (epithelium) that allows toxic substances in urine to irritate the bladder wall, an autoimmune reaction, or a specific type of inflammation.","Pain in the pelvis or between the vagina/scrotum and anus; chronic pelvic pain; a persistent, urgent need to urinate; frequent urination, often of small amounts, throughout the day and night.","There are no known ways to prevent IC, but managing the condition involves identifying and avoiding triggers that worsen symptoms. Common triggers include certain foods and beverages (the '4 Cs': carbonated drinks, caffeine, citrus fruits, and food with high vitamin C).",*Disclaimer: Medical diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan are necessary.* Following an IC-friendly diet by eliminating common trigger foods can provide significant relief. Stress management techniques are crucial as stress can cause flare-ups. Bladder training (urinating at set times) may help increase bladder capacity over time.,IC/BPS is a complex and often misunderstood condition that can be debilitating. It is not a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is not caused by a psychological problem. Raising awareness helps patients get a correct diagnosis sooner.,"While not a specific focus area, WHO's work on noncommunicable diseases and pain management provides a framework for addressing chronic conditions like IC/BPS. It advocates for patient-centered care and access to multidisciplinary pain management services."
Iron Deficiency Anemia,"The most common type of anemia, a condition in which the blood lacks adequate healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's tissues. As the name implies, it's due to insufficient iron.","Caused by blood loss (e.g., heavy menstrual periods, internal bleeding), a lack of iron in the diet, an inability to absorb iron (e.g., from celiac disease), or pregnancy, which increases iron demands.","Fatigue and weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, cold hands and feet, brittle nails, and sometimes strange cravings to eat items that aren't food (pica), such as ice or dirt.","Eat a balanced diet rich in iron. Good sources include red meat, beans, lentils, iron-fortified cereals, dark green leafy vegetables, and dried fruit. Consuming vitamin C (e.g., from citrus fruits) with iron-rich foods enhances absorption.","*Disclaimer: Consult a doctor for diagnosis and to rule out serious underlying causes.* In addition to a diet rich in iron, cooking in cast-iron skillets can add iron to food. Avoid drinking tea or coffee with meals as they can inhibit iron absorption. Do not take iron supplements without a doctor's recommendation, as too much iron can be toxic.","It's a very common nutritional deficiency, especially among women of childbearing age and young children. Symptoms can be subtle and develop slowly, so awareness is important for early detection and treatment.","WHO identifies iron deficiency as a major global public health problem. It has numerous guidelines and programs aimed at preventing and controlling it, including promoting dietary diversification, food fortification with iron, and iron supplementation for high-risk groups."
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),"A common disorder that affects the large intestine. It is a functional gastrointestinal disorder, meaning there are no signs of damage or disease in the gut, but the gut doesn't work as it should.","The exact cause is not known. Factors that appear to play a role include problems with how the gut muscles contract, increased sensitivity to pain in the gut (visceral hypersensitivity), and changes in the gut-brain interaction. Stress and certain foods can trigger symptoms.","Cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea or constipation, or both. Symptoms are chronic but often come and go in periods of flare-ups and remission.","Managing stress is a key preventive measure. Eating a healthy, balanced diet and getting regular exercise can also help regulate bowel function. Identifying and avoiding personal food triggers is crucial for managing symptoms.",*Disclaimer: A medical diagnosis is needed to rule out other conditions.* Keeping a food and symptom diary is a very effective tool. Many find relief with a low-FODMAP diet (under guidance). Peppermint oil capsules may help with cramping. Increasing soluble fiber (like psyllium) can help with both constipation and diarrhea. Probiotics may also be beneficial.,"IBS is a real, often frustrating condition, not just 'nerves'. It's different from IBD. Awareness helps reduce stigma and encourages people to seek medical help for a proper diagnosis and management plan.",WHO recognizes the impact of functional gastrointestinal disorders like IBS on quality of life and healthcare systems. Its focus on mental health and managing noncommunicable diseases provides a framework for an integrated approach to care.
Jaundice,"A condition in which the skin, the whites of the eyes (sclera), and mucous membranes turn yellow because of a high level of bilirubin, a yellow-orange bile pigment. Jaundice itself is a sign of an underlying disease process.","Caused by an excess of bilirubin. This can happen if the liver isn't functioning properly (e.g., due to hepatitis or cirrhosis), if red blood cells are breaking down too rapidly, or if the bile ducts are blocked (e.g., by gallstones or a tumor).","Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, dark-colored urine, and pale or clay-colored stools. Depending on the underlying cause, other symptoms like fatigue, abdominal pain, or fever may be present.","Prevention is focused on the underlying causes. This includes getting vaccinated for hepatitis A and B, drinking alcohol in moderation to prevent liver damage, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing cholesterol to reduce the risk of gallstones.","*Disclaimer: Jaundice requires immediate medical evaluation to determine the cause.* Home care depends on the cause. General advice includes staying well-hydrated, avoiding alcohol and any medications that can harm the liver (consult a doctor), and eating a healthy diet.","Jaundice is a clear sign that something is wrong with the body's normal processes. It is very common and usually harmless in newborns (physiologic jaundice), but in adults, it almost always indicates a medical problem that needs investigation.","WHO addresses the primary causes of jaundice through various programs. Its global hepatitis strategy aims to eliminate viral hepatitis, a major cause of jaundice. It also promotes safe blood transfusions and works to improve maternal and newborn health, which includes managing neonatal jaundice."
Kaposiâs Sarcoma,"A type of cancer that causes lesions (abnormal tissue) to grow in the skin, lymph nodes, internal organs, and mucous membranes lining the mouth, nose, and throat. It is caused by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).","Caused by infection with HHV-8. The virus alone is often not enough to cause the cancer. It typically develops in people with a weakened immune system, most commonly in people with advanced HIV infection (AIDS). It can also affect organ transplant recipients.","The most visible signs are lesions on the skin, which appear as purplish, reddish-blue, or brown-black spots or nodules. They are usually painless. In more advanced cases, it can cause swelling in the limbs (lymphedema) and affect internal organs.","Preventing HIV infection through safe sex practices is the most effective way to prevent AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. For transplant patients, careful management of immunosuppressive drugs is important. There is no vaccine for HHV-8.","*Disclaimer: This cancer requires specialized medical treatment.* Home care is supportive, focusing on wound care for skin lesions if they become open or weepy, and managing lymphedema through compression garments and gentle exercise as advised by a therapist.","The presence of Kaposi's sarcoma was one of the early indicators of the AIDS epidemic. It is now considered an AIDS-defining illness. With effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma has dramatically decreased.","WHO's strategies to combat HIV/AIDS are central to preventing Kaposi's sarcoma. This includes promoting HIV testing, prevention, and universal access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which restores immune function and can cause KS lesions to shrink or disappear."
Kidney Infection (Pyelonephritis),A type of urinary tract infection (UTI) that generally begins in your urethra or bladder and travels to one or both of your kidneys. A kidney infection requires prompt medical attention.,"Caused by bacteria, most commonly Escherichia coli (E. coli), that enter the urinary tract through the urethra and multiply, traveling up to the kidneys. Risk factors include being female, having a urinary catheter, or having a kidney stone or other blockage.","Fever, chills, back, side (flank) or groin pain, abdominal pain, frequent urination, strong, persistent urge to urinate, burning sensation or pain when urinating, and nausea and vomiting.","To prevent UTIs that can lead to kidney infections: drink plenty of fluids (especially water), urinate when you feel the need and completely empty the bladder, wipe from front to back after using the toilet (for women), and urinate after sexual intercourse.","*Disclaimer: A kidney infection requires immediate medical treatment with antibiotics.* While waiting for antibiotics to work, drink plenty of water to help flush bacteria from the urinary system. Use a heating pad on your back or abdomen to relieve pain. Get plenty of rest. Avoid coffee and alcohol.",A kidney infection is a serious medical condition that can lead to permanent kidney damage or a life-threatening blood infection (sepsis) if not treated promptly. It is much more serious than a simple bladder infection (cystitis).,"WHO guidelines on antimicrobial resistance are relevant, as they stress the importance of appropriate antibiotic use for infections like pyelonephritis to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. It also promotes hygiene and sanitation to prevent UTIs."
Kidney Stones,Hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys. They can affect any part of the urinary tract from the kidneys to the bladder. Passing kidney stones can be quite painful.,"Stones form when your urine contains more crystal-forming substancesâsuch as calcium, oxalate, and uric acidâthan the fluid in your urine can dilute. Dehydration is a major risk factor. Certain diets, medical conditions, and supplements can also contribute.","Severe, sharp pain in the side and back, below the ribs; pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and groin; pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity; pain or burning sensation while urinating; pink, red, or brown urine; cloudy or foul-smelling urine.","Drink plenty of water throughout the day (enough to produce clear or light-yellow urine) â this is the most important measure. Eating a diet low in salt and animal protein can also help. Depending on the type of stone, you may need to limit foods high in oxalate (like spinach, nuts).","*Disclaimer: See a doctor for diagnosis and to manage severe pain.* For small stones, drinking 2-3 quarts of water a day can help flush the urinary system. Over-the-counter pain relievers can help with discomfort. Some people find relief with a mixture of lemon juice and olive oil, though this is not scientifically proven. Follow any dietary advice given by your doctor.",Kidney stones are very common. The pain is often described as one of the most severe types of pain imaginable. Staying hydrated is the single best way to reduce your risk.,"WHO addresses kidney stones as part of the broader category of kidney diseases. Its public health recommendations on healthy diets, such as reducing sodium intake and promoting adequate water consumption, are key preventive strategies."
Klebsiella Infection,"Infections caused by Klebsiella bacteria. These bacteria normally live in the human intestines and stool without causing problems, but they can be dangerous if they get into other parts of the body, especially in people with weakened immune systems.",The infection is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae or other Klebsiella species. It is often spread in healthcare settings (nosocomial infection) through person-to-person contact or contaminated medical equipment. Healthy people are rarely affected.,"Symptoms depend on the site of infection. Pneumonia causes fever, cough, and chest pain. A UTI causes urinary symptoms. A bloodstream infection (bacteremia) can cause fever, chills, and confusion, and can lead to life-threatening sepsis.","In healthcare settings, strict infection control measures like hand hygiene, sterilization of equipment, and isolation of infected patients are crucial. In the community, good personal hygiene can help.","*Disclaimer: Klebsiella infections require specific antibiotic treatment based on lab tests.* There are no specific home treatments for the infection itself. Supportive care at home after hospital discharge would involve rest, hydration, and completing the full course of prescribed antibiotics.","The major concern with Klebsiella infections is the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and other carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), which are very difficult to treat.","WHO has declared antimicrobial resistance (AMR) a top global public health threat. Klebsiella is a priority pathogen in WHO's Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS). Guidelines focus on surveillance, infection prevention, and stewardship of antibiotics."
Kyphosis,"An exaggerated, forward rounding of the back. It can occur at any age but is most common in older women, where it's often known as a 'dowager's hump'. A mild curve is normal, but a severe curve can be painful and disfiguring.","Can be caused by osteoporosis (which weakens vertebrae), degenerative disk disease, birth defects (congenital kyphosis), or poor posture over time (postural kyphosis). Scheuermann's disease is a common cause in teens.","A visible hump on the back, back pain and stiffness, fatigue. In severe cases, it can affect breathing and digestion due to pressure on the lungs and stomach.","Maintaining good posture, strengthening back and core muscles, and ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake to prevent osteoporosis are key preventive measures.","*Disclaimer: Medical evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.* For postural kyphosis, exercises to strengthen the back and core and conscious efforts to improve posture are the primary treatment. A physical therapist can provide a specific exercise regimen. Using ergonomic chairs and workstations can also help.","Awareness about the importance of posture, especially with increased screen time in both children and adults, is crucial for prevention. For older adults, preventing falls and managing osteoporosis is vital to avoid spinal fractures that can lead to kyphosis.","WHO's strategies on healthy aging and prevention of noncommunicable diseases include recommendations for physical activity and nutrition, which are essential for maintaining bone and muscle strength, thereby helping to prevent conditions like kyphosis."
Lactose Intolerance,"A digestive disorder caused by the inability to digest lactose, the main carbohydrate in dairy products. It's caused by a deficiency of the enzyme lactase in the small intestine.","The primary cause is a genetically determined decrease in lactase production over time (primary lactase nonpersistence), which is very common. It can also be caused by injury to the small intestine from infection or diseases like celiac disease (secondary lactose intolerance).","Symptoms occur after consuming dairy and include bloating, gas, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and sometimes nausea. The severity of symptoms depends on the amount of lactose consumed and the individual's level of intolerance.","This is not a preventable condition, but symptoms can be prevented by managing the diet. Avoid or limit foods and drinks containing lactose. Read food labels carefully, as lactose is often a hidden ingredient.","Manage symptoms by controlling lactose intake. Many people can tolerate small amounts of lactose, especially in yogurt or hard cheeses. Lactose-free milk and dairy products are widely available. Over-the-counter lactase enzyme tablets or drops can be taken with dairy to help digestion.","Lactose intolerance is not a milk allergy. An allergy involves the immune system and can be life-threatening, whereas intolerance involves the digestive system and is not dangerous, though it can be very uncomfortable.","WHO recognizes the importance of culturally appropriate dietary guidelines. While dairy is promoted in some regions for its calcium content, guidelines also acknowledge lactose intolerance and suggest alternative calcium sources like fortified foods, leafy greens, and fish with edible bones."
Laryngeal Cancer,"Cancer that forms in the tissues of the larynx (voice box). The larynx is in the neck and contains the vocal cords, which vibrate and make sound when air is directed against them.",The main risk factors are tobacco use (smoking and smokeless tobacco) and heavy alcohol consumption. The combination of smoking and drinking increases the risk significantly. Other risks include infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and occupational exposure to certain chemicals.,"A persistent sore throat, a change in the voice or hoarseness that doesn't go away, pain when swallowing, a lump in the neck, and a persistent cough.",The most effective prevention is to not use tobacco products and to limit alcohol consumption. Eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables may also lower the risk. Practicing safe sex can reduce the risk of HPV infection.,"*Disclaimer: Cancer requires immediate medical treatment.* Home care is focused on supporting treatment and recovery. This includes following dietary advice (often soft foods or liquids if swallowing is painful), using a humidifier to soothe the throat, and using alternative communication methods if the voice is affected.",Early detection greatly improves the chances of successful treatment and preserving the voice. Any hoarseness or voice change lasting more than two to three weeks should be checked by a doctor. This is especially important for smokers and heavy drinkers.,"WHO's cancer prevention strategies strongly focus on tobacco and alcohol control through policies like taxation, advertising bans, and cessation programs. It also promotes HPV vaccination, which can help prevent laryngeal and other cancers."
Laryngitis,"An inflammation of the voice box (larynx) from overuse, irritation, or infection. It causes the vocal cords to become inflamed or irritated, which makes them swell, distorting the sounds they produce.","Most commonly caused by a viral infection, similar to the common cold. It can also be caused by vocal strain (yelling or overuse of the voice), irritants like smoke, or bacterial infections. Chronic laryngitis can be caused by acid reflux (GERD) or smoking.","The main symptoms are hoarseness, a weak voice, or complete loss of voice. Other symptoms can include a tickling sensation and rawness in the throat, a sore throat, dry throat, and a dry cough.","To prevent laryngitis, avoid vocal strain, stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke, limit alcohol and caffeine (which can dry out the throat), and drink plenty of water. Wash hands frequently to avoid catching viral infections.","The best treatment for viral laryngitis is to rest your voice as much as possibleâthis is crucial. Whispering actually strains the voice more than speaking softly. Drink warm, soothing fluids like tea with honey. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air. Avoid decongestants, which can dry out the throat.","Most cases of laryngitis are temporary and resolve on their own with self-care.

The majority disappear without treatment within a few months.,Most ovarian cysts develop as a result of the normal function of your menstrual cycle. These are known as functional cysts. Other types of cysts are less common and can be caused by conditions like endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).,"Most cysts don't cause symptoms. If a cyst does cause symptoms, you might have pelvic pain, bloating or swelling in the abdomen, and pain during intercourse. A ruptured cyst can cause sudden, severe pain.",Functional ovarian cysts are a normal part of the menstrual cycle and cannot be prevented. Hormonal contraceptives (like birth control pills) may be prescribed to prevent the recurrence of certain types of cysts.,**Disclaimer:** See a doctor for pelvic pain to get an accurate diagnosis. A heating pad or warm bath can help soothe pelvic pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also provide relief. Most cysts resolve on their own with 'watchful waiting.',"While most ovarian cysts are benign, some can be cancerous, especially those that develop after menopause. It is important to have any ovarian cyst evaluated by a doctor. Sudden, severe abdominal pain could be a sign of a ruptured cyst, which requires immediate medical attention.","WHO supports sexual and reproductive health services, which include the diagnosis and management of gynecological conditions like ovarian cysts. They promote access to care for women to ensure that potentially serious conditions are identified and treated appropriately."
Pancreatic Cancer,Cancer that begins in the tissues of your pancreas â an organ in your abdomen that lies behind the lower part of your stomach. The pancreas releases enzymes that aid digestion and produces hormones that help manage your blood sugar.,"The exact cause is unknown, but risk factors include smoking, diabetes, chronic inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), a family history of pancreatic cancer, obesity, and older age.","Pancreatic cancer is often difficult to detect early because it doesn't cause symptoms until it has grown and spread. When symptoms do appear, they can include pain in the upper abdomen that radiates to your back, loss of appetite, weight loss, jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), and new-onset diabetes.","You can reduce your risk by stopping smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a healthy diet. Managing diabetes and avoiding causes of pancreatitis (like heavy alcohol use) are also important.","**Disclaimer:** Pancreatic cancer is a very serious disease that requires aggressive medical treatment. There is no home remedy. Supportive care is focused on managing pain, improving nutrition, and getting emotional support during treatment.","Pancreatic cancer has a low survival rate, primarily because it is often diagnosed at a late stage. Research is focused on finding better ways to detect the disease earlier. Awareness of the subtle symptoms is key.","WHO addresses pancreatic cancer within its broader cancer control programs. These programs emphasize prevention by tackling risk factors like tobacco use and promoting healthy diets, as well as improving access to early diagnosis and treatment."
Panic Disorder,"An anxiety disorder characterized by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms that may include chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or abdominal distress. These episodes are called panic attacks.","The exact cause is not fully understood, but it's likely a combination of genetic predisposition, major stress, temperament that is more sensitive to stress, and certain changes in the way parts of your brain function.","Symptoms of a panic attack can include a sense of impending doom, fear of loss of control or death, rapid heart rate, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chills or hot flashes, and nausea. The attacks are sudden and often peak within 10 minutes.","There is no sure way to prevent panic attacks or panic disorder. However, seeking treatment as soon as symptoms appear can help. Reducing stress, practicing relaxation techniques, and avoiding caffeine and stimulants may also be helpful.","**Disclaimer:** Panic disorder is a treatable medical condition. Professional therapy (especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and medication are the primary treatments. At home, practice deep breathing exercises to manage symptoms during an attack. Regular physical activity can help reduce overall anxiety.",Panic attacks can be terrifying because they can feel like a heart attack. The disorder is not just about having a panic attack; it's the persistent fear of having another one that causes significant disruption to a person's life.,"WHO's Mental Health Action Plan promotes mental health services for all. It advocates for evidence-based care for mental disorders, including anxiety disorders like panic disorder, and works to reduce the stigma associated with seeking help."
Parkinsonâs Disease,"A progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. It develops gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. The disease is also associated with stiffness, slowing of movement, and balance problems.","In Parkinson's, certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually break down or die. Many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine. The exact cause is unknown but involves genetic and environmental factors.","The four main symptoms are tremor (shaking), which often begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers; bradykinesia (slowed movement); rigidity (muscle stiffness); and impaired posture and balance.","Because the cause is unknown, there is no proven way to prevent the disease. Some research suggests that regular aerobic exercise and consuming caffeine may be associated with a lower risk, but more studies are needed.","**Disclaimer:** Parkinson's disease requires management by a neurologist. Home care involves creating a safe environment to prevent falls, performing exercises prescribed by a physical therapist to maintain mobility and balance, and adapting activities to accommodate slower movement.","Parkinson's is a chronic and progressive disease, meaning symptoms worsen over time. There is no cure, but medications and therapies can significantly relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.",WHO recognizes Parkinson's disease as a significant neurological condition. It supports initiatives to improve access to care and treatment for people with neurological disorders and promotes research to better understand and manage the disease.
Peptic Ulcer,Open sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach (gastric ulcers) and the upper portion of your small intestine (duodenal ulcers).,"The most common causes are infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Stress and spicy foods do not cause peptic ulcers, but they can make symptoms worse.","The most common symptom is stomach pain. The pain is often a burning sensation that can be felt anywhere from your navel up to your breastbone. Other symptoms include feeling full, bloating, and nausea.","To prevent ulcers, protect yourself from H. pylori infection by washing your hands frequently and eating food that has been cooked properly. Use NSAIDs cautiously and for the shortest duration possible. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol.","**Disclaimer:** A doctor should diagnose and treat peptic ulcers. If H. pylori is the cause, antibiotics are required. Home care can support medical treatment: avoid foods that irritate your stomach (like spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol) and manage stress.","Untreated peptic ulcers can lead to serious complications like internal bleeding, a hole (perforation) in the stomach wall, and obstruction of the digestive tract. It is not a condition to be self-managed.","WHO provides guidance on the management of H. pylori infection, a primary cause of peptic ulcers and a risk factor for stomach cancer. They promote strategies for appropriate antibiotic use to treat the infection and prevent resistance."
Pericarditis,"Swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike membrane surrounding the heart (pericardium). Pericarditis is often mild and usually improves on its own.","A specific cause is often difficult to determine. Viral infections are thought to be a common cause. Other causes include heart attack or heart surgery, other medical conditions, injuries, and certain medications.","The most common symptom is a sharp, stabbing chest pain that may feel like a heart attack. The pain often worsens when coughing, lying down, or taking a deep breath and may improve when sitting up and leaning forward.",Most cases can't be prevented. Prompt treatment of infections and managing inflammatory conditions may help reduce the risk. Getting vaccinated can help prevent some infectious diseases that might cause pericarditis.,**Disclaimer:** Chest pain requires an immediate medical evaluation to rule out a heart attack. Treatment for pericarditis often involves rest and over-the-counter pain relievers or anti-inflammatory drugs. Follow your doctor's advice on activity restrictions.,"While usually mild, some cases of pericarditis can lead to serious complications, such as a buildup of fluid around the heart (cardiac tamponade) or chronic scarring of the pericardium. Follow-up with a doctor is important.","WHO's work on cardiovascular health includes addressing a wide range of conditions affecting the heart. While less common than heart attacks, pericarditis is part of the spectrum of diseases for which they promote access to diagnosis and care."
Peritonitis,"Inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the abdominal organs.","It is usually caused by a bacterial or fungal infection. The infection can result from any rupture in your abdomen, such as a burst appendix, a stomach ulcer, or a perforated colon. It can also be a complication of dialysis or liver disease with ascites.","Symptoms include severe abdominal pain or tenderness, bloating, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The abdomen may become rigid and board-like. It is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.",Preventing the underlying causes is key. This includes seeking prompt treatment for appendicitis or stomach ulcers. Patients on peritoneal dialysis must follow strict hygiene procedures to prevent infection.,"**Disclaimer:** Peritonitis is a medical emergency requiring hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, and possibly surgery. There is no home treatment. It is a life-threatening condition.","If left untreated, peritonitis can lead to a severe, body-wide infection (sepsis), shock, and death. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical for a good outcome.",WHO emphasizes infection prevention and control in all healthcare settings. This includes promoting sterile techniques for procedures like dialysis and surgical best practices to prevent complications like peritonitis. They also focus on the rapid management of sepsis.
Pertussis (Whooping Cough),"A highly contagious respiratory tract infection. In its early stages, it may seem like a common cold, but it can become more serious, especially for infants.",It is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It spreads easily from person to person through tiny droplets of fluid from an infected person's nose or mouth when they cough or sneeze.,"Early symptoms mimic a cold: runny nose, low-grade fever, and mild cough. After 1-2 weeks, the cough can turn into severe coughing spells that end in a high-pitched 'whoop' sound when the person tries to breathe in air. Vomiting after coughing spells is common.","The best way to prevent pertussis is to get vaccinated. The DTaP vaccine is for children, and the Tdap booster is for preteens, teens, and adults. Vaccinating pregnant women is crucial to protect their newborn babies.","**Disclaimer:** Pertussis requires medical diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics. Home care involves managing the coughing spells. Keep the air clean and use a cool-mist vaporizer. Encourage small, frequent servings of fluids to prevent dehydration.","Whooping cough can be very serious, even deadly, for babies who are too young to be fully vaccinated. The coughing spells can be so severe that they make it hard for an infant to breathe, eat, or drink. Family members should be vaccinated to create a 'cocoon' of protection around the baby.","WHO strongly recommends routine pertussis vaccination for all infants and children as part of global immunization programs. They monitor disease outbreaks and promote vaccination strategies, including booster doses for adolescents and adults, to control the disease."
Phenylketonuria (PKU),A rare inherited disorder that causes an amino acid called phenylalanine to build up in the body. PKU is caused by a defect in the gene that helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine.,It is a genetic disorder passed down from parents to children. A child must inherit a copy of the mutated gene from both parents to develop the condition. People who inherit only one copy are carriers but do not have the disease.,"Newborns with PKU initially don't have any symptoms. Without treatment, however, infants develop signs of PKU within a few months. Symptoms can include developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral problems. A musty odor in the breath, skin, or urine is a characteristic sign.","PKU cannot be prevented. However, newborn screening tests can detect it shortly after birth. If a couple has a family history of PKU, genetic counseling before pregnancy can help them understand their risk of having a child with the disorder.","**Disclaimer:** PKU is managed by a lifelong special diet and medical supervision. The diet strictly limits intake of foods containing phenylalanine, which is found in most proteins. This includes avoiding high-protein foods like meat, milk, eggs, and nuts. Medical formulas provide necessary nutrients.","With early diagnosis and strict adherence to a special diet, individuals with PKU can live healthy lives with normal development and intelligence. The newborn screening program is a major public health success that prevents severe disability from this disease.",WHO supports newborn screening programs for genetic and metabolic disorders like PKU. Early detection and treatment are cornerstones of public health strategies to prevent disability and improve health outcomes in children.
Piles (Hemorrhoids),"Swollen veins in your lower rectum and anus, similar to varicose veins. They can develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids).","They are often caused by straining during bowel movements, which increases pressure on the veins in the lower rectum. Other contributing factors include chronic constipation or diarrhea, obesity, pregnancy, and sitting for long periods on the toilet.","Symptoms often include painless bleeding during bowel movements (bright red blood), itching or irritation in the anal region, pain or discomfort, and a lump near the anus.","To prevent hemorrhoids, avoid straining during bowel movements. Eat high-fiber foods, drink plenty of fluids, and get regular exercise to prevent constipation. Go to the bathroom as soon as you feel the urge.","For mild discomfort, over-the-counter creams or suppositories can provide relief. Soaking in a warm bath (sitz bath) for 10-15 minutes several times a day can soothe the area. Using moist towelettes instead of dry toilet paper can also help.","Hemorrhoids are very common but usually not serious. They often go away on their own with simple lifestyle changes. However, rectal bleeding should always be evaluated by a doctor to rule out more serious conditions.","While not a major focus of global health policy, WHO's recommendations on healthy diets, rich in fiber from fruits and vegetables, and physical activity for preventing noncommunicable diseases also help in preventing conditions like hemorrhoids."
Pityriasis Rosea,"A common skin rash that is usually mild. It typically begins with a single, large oval patch on the chest, abdomen, or back, called a 'herald patch.' This is followed by smaller patches on the torso and upper arms and legs.","The exact cause is unknown, but it's thought to be triggered by a viral infection, possibly from a strain of the human herpesvirus. It is not considered to be contagious.",The rash often forms a pattern on the back that resembles the outline of a Christmas tree. The patches can be pink or red and may be slightly scaly. It can sometimes be itchy.,"Since the cause is unknown, there is no way to prevent it. It typically affects people between the ages of 10 and 35 and usually occurs once in a lifetime.","**Disclaimer:** A doctor should confirm the diagnosis to rule out other skin conditions. The rash usually goes away on its own within 6-10 weeks without treatment. For itching, lukewarm baths, oatmeal baths, and over-the-counter anti-itch lotions (like calamine) can be helpful.","Pityriasis rosea is a self-limiting condition, meaning it resolves on its own. While the rash can be widespread and concerning in appearance, it is harmless and does not leave permanent marks.","WHO does not have specific guidelines for common, self-limiting skin conditions like pityriasis rosea. Its focus is on skin diseases with a high burden of morbidity or mortality, such as leprosy or skin cancers."
Plague,"A serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, which are often found on small rodents.","It is a zoonotic disease, primarily affecting rodents. Humans can get it from the bite of an infected flea, direct contact with an infected animal, or inhaling infectious droplets from a person or animal with pneumonic plague.","There are three main forms: bubonic plague (causing swollen, painful lymph nodes called buboes), septicemic plague (a blood infection), and pneumonic plague (infecting the lungs, the most serious form). Symptoms include fever, chills, weakness, and headache.",Prevention involves reducing rodent habitat around your home and workplace. Use insect repellent containing DEET to prevent flea bites when in areas where plague is endemic. Avoid handling sick or dead animals.,**Disclaimer:** Plague is a medical emergency that requires immediate hospitalization and treatment with antibiotics. There is no home treatment. It is a life-threatening disease.,"With prompt diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate of bubonic plague is significantly reduced. Untreated, it has a very high fatality rate. Pneumonic plague is particularly dangerous because it can be spread from person to person.","WHO monitors plague outbreaks worldwide and provides technical support to countries for surveillance, diagnosis, and control. It works to ensure access to rapid diagnostic tests and appropriate antibiotics in affected regions."
Pneumonia,"An infection that inflames the air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.","It can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viruses like influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 can also cause pneumonia.","Symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening and include chest pain when you breathe or cough, cough which may produce phlegm, fatigue, fever, sweating and shaking chills, and shortness of breath.","Vaccines are available to prevent some types of pneumonia (e.g., pneumococcal and flu vaccines). Other preventive measures include practicing good hygiene (frequent hand washing), not smoking, and managing chronic health conditions.","**Disclaimer:** Pneumonia requires medical diagnosis and treatment, which may include antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia. Home care involves getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids to stay hydrated, and using a humidifier to help loosen mucus.","Pneumonia can be particularly serious for infants, young children, people older than 65, and people with underlying health problems or weakened immune systems. It is a leading cause of death in children worldwide.","WHO works to combat pneumonia, the single largest infectious cause of death in children globally. Their strategy includes promoting vaccination, encouraging breastfeeding, improving nutrition, and ensuring access to effective antibiotics and oxygen therapy."
Polio (Poliomyelitis),"A disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus spreads from person to person and can infect a person's spinal cord, causing paralysis.","It is a highly contagious viral disease transmitted through the fecal-oral route, typically from person-to-person contact or through contaminated water or food.","Most people infected with poliovirus (about 72%) will not have any visible symptoms. About 1 in 4 people will have flu-like symptoms. A smaller proportion of people will develop more serious symptoms that affect the brain and spinal cord, including paralysis.",The only way to prevent polio is through vaccination. There are two types of vaccine: the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Multiple doses are required for full protection.,"**Disclaimer:** There is no cure for polio once a person is infected. Treatment involves supportive care to manage symptoms, such as rest, pain relievers, and physical therapy to help with muscle weakness.","Thanks to a global vaccination campaign, polio has been eliminated from most of the world. However, it still exists in a few countries, and as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of contracting the disease.","WHO leads the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a public-private partnership. The initiative's goal is to completely eradicate the disease worldwide through routine immunization, surveillance, and outbreak response activities."
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),"A mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event â either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.","It can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as combat, a natural disaster, a car accident, or sexual assault. Not everyone with trauma gets PTSD. A combination of factors, including the severity of the trauma and individual resilience, plays a role.","Symptoms are grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. These symptoms last for more than a month and cause significant distress or problems in functioning.","There is no way to prevent PTSD, but seeking help and support soon after a traumatic event can be beneficial. Having a strong support system and learning healthy coping strategies can help reduce the risk of developing severe symptoms.","**Disclaimer:** PTSD requires professional treatment, such as psychotherapy (trauma-focused CBT, EMDR) and medication. Self-care strategies that can support treatment include mindfulness, exercise, connecting with others, and avoiding alcohol and drugs.","PTSD is not a sign of weakness. It is a normal reaction to an abnormal event. With treatment, people can learn to manage their symptoms and process the trauma, leading to significant recovery.","WHO recognizes the significant mental health impact of trauma and conflict. It provides guidance and tools for managing mental health conditions like PTSD, especially in humanitarian settings, and works to integrate mental health support into health systems."
Pregnancy Complications,"Health problems that occur during pregnancy. They can involve the mother's health, the baby's health, or both. Some women have health problems before they become pregnant that could lead to complications.","Complications can be caused by pre-existing conditions (like high blood pressure or diabetes), problems that develop during pregnancy (like preeclampsia or gestational diabetes), or issues with the pregnancy itself (like placenta previa).","Symptoms vary widely depending on the complication. Examples include high blood pressure (preeclampsia), high blood sugar (gestational diabetes), severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum), and vaginal bleeding.","Pre-conception care is important. Managing existing health conditions, taking folic acid, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol can reduce risks. Regular prenatal care is essential for monitoring the pregnancy and catching problems early.","**Disclaimer:** All pregnancy complications must be managed by a healthcare provider. Home care involves closely following the doctor's instructions, which may include bed rest, dietary changes, monitoring blood pressure or blood sugar, and being aware of warning signs.","Good prenatal care is the best way to ensure a healthy pregnancy. It allows for the early detection and management of potential complications, improving outcomes for both mother and baby.","WHO's goal for maternal health is to end preventable maternal mortality. They provide global standards and guidelines for quality antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care to prevent and manage pregnancy complications effectively."
Prostate Cancer,Cancer that occurs in the prostate â a small walnut-shaped gland in men that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. It is one of the most common types of cancer in men.,"The exact cause is not known, but it begins when cells in the prostate gland start to grow out of control. Risk factors include older age, African-American race, and a family history of the disease.","Prostate cancer may cause no signs or symptoms in its early stages. More-advanced cancer may cause trouble urinating, blood in the semen, discomfort in the pelvic area, bone pain, and erectile dysfunction.","There is no sure way to prevent prostate cancer, but evidence suggests that choosing a healthy diet low in fat and rich in fruits and vegetables, and maintaining a healthy weight may reduce the risk.","**Disclaimer:** Prostate cancer requires medical treatment. There are no home remedies. After treatment, supportive care includes managing side effects like incontinence or erectile dysfunction and following a healthy lifestyle.",Screening for prostate cancer (with a PSA blood test) is a decision that a man should make with his doctor after discussing the potential benefits and harms. Many prostate cancers grow slowly and may not need immediate treatment.,WHO includes prostate cancer in its global cancer control strategies. It promotes public awareness of the signs and symptoms and advocates for access to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment options for men with the disease.
Psoriasis,A chronic autoimmune skin disease that causes a rapid buildup of skin cells. This buildup of cells causes scaling on the skin's surface. Inflammation and redness around the scales are common.,"Psoriasis is an immune system problem. The immune system overreacts, causing inflammation and rapid skin cell production. Genetics play a major role, and it can be triggered by factors like stress, infections (like strep throat), and certain medications.","The most common type, plaque psoriasis, appears as raised, red patches covered with a silvery-white buildup of dead skin cells (scales). These patches are often itchy and sometimes painful. They can appear anywhere on the body.","There is no way to prevent psoriasis. However, identifying and avoiding personal triggers, such as stress or certain foods, can help reduce the frequency and severity of flare-ups.",**Disclaimer:** Psoriasis should be managed by a dermatologist. Home care can help manage symptoms. Daily moisturizing is crucial to reduce dryness and scaling. Lukewarm baths with oatmeal or Epsom salts can soothe itching. Sunlight exposure in moderation may also help.,"Psoriasis is more than just a skin condition. It is a chronic systemic disease that is associated with other serious health conditions, including psoriatic arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes. It can have a significant impact on mental health and quality of life.","WHO recognizes psoriasis as a serious noncommunicable disease. In 2014, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution to raise awareness and advocate for improved access to care for people with psoriasis worldwide."
Psychosis,"A condition that affects the way your brain processes information. It causes you to lose touch with reality. You might see, hear, or believe things that aren't real. It is a symptom, not an illness.","Psychosis can be a symptom of a mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. It can also be caused by a physical condition (like a brain tumor or dementia), substance use (alcohol or drugs), or extreme stress or trauma.","The main symptoms are hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) and delusions (strong beliefs that are not based in reality). Other signs include confused and disturbed thoughts, and disorganized speech and behavior.","Preventing psychosis involves managing the underlying condition that is causing it. For individuals at high risk, early intervention services that provide therapy, family support, and low-dose medication may help prevent or delay the first episode of psychosis.","**Disclaimer:** Psychosis is a medical emergency that requires immediate professional help. The primary goal is to get the person into a safe environment and to obtain a proper diagnosis and treatment, which usually involves antipsychotic medication and therapy.","Experiencing psychosis can be very frightening and confusing. It is a treatable condition, and early intervention is key to a better recovery. Support from family and friends is very important.","WHO's mental health programs emphasize the importance of early detection and evidence-based care for severe mental disorders that can cause psychosis, such as schizophrenia. They work to improve access to community-based mental healthcare."
Rabies,A deadly virus spread to people from the saliva of infected animals. The rabies virus is usually transmitted through a bite.,"Rabies is caused by a lyssavirus that infects the central nervous system. In the vast majority of human cases, the virus is transmitted by a dog bite. It can also be transmitted by other mammals, such as bats, raccoons, and foxes.","Early symptoms can be very similar to the flu, including fever, headache, and general weakness. As the disease progresses, more specific symptoms appear and may include insomnia, anxiety, confusion, paralysis, hallucinations, and hydrophobia (fear of water).","Vaccinating pets (especially dogs) is the most effective way to prevent rabies in people. Avoid contact with wild animals. If you work with animals or travel to high-risk areas, consider pre-exposure vaccination. After a potential exposure, immediate wound washing and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are crucial.","**Disclaimer:** Rabies is a medical emergency. There is no home treatment. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal that could have rabies, you must wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water and seek immediate medical attention to receive PEP.","Once clinical symptoms of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal. That is why post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is so critical. It is highly effective at preventing the disease if given promptly after exposure.","WHO leads global efforts to eliminate human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. The strategy focuses on mass dog vaccination, ensuring access to post-exposure prophylaxis for bite victims, and increasing public awareness."
Rectal Prolapse,"A medical condition in which the rectum (the last part of the large intestine) loses its normal attachments inside the body and turns itself 'inside out,' protruding through the anus.","The exact cause is not always clear, but it is often associated with conditions that increase pressure in the abdomen. Risk factors include chronic straining from constipation, damage from childbirth, weakness of the pelvic floor muscles with age, and previous pelvic surgery.","The main symptom is the feeling or sight of a reddish-colored mass protruding from the anus, especially after a bowel movement. Other symptoms can include fecal incontinence, constipation, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation.","Preventing constipation and straining is the most important step. Eat a high-fiber diet, drink plenty of fluids, and get regular exercise. If you have to strain, pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) may help strengthen the muscles.",**Disclaimer:** Rectal prolapse should be evaluated by a doctor. Treatment often requires surgery. Home care before or after treatment involves managing constipation with diet and fiber supplements to avoid straining.,"Rectal prolapse can be uncomfortable and distressing, significantly affecting quality of life. It is more common in older women. While not life-threatening, it is a progressive condition that usually requires surgical correction.",WHO does not have specific guidelines for rectal prolapse but promotes healthy aging and the management of chronic conditions. Their recommendations on diet and exercise for overall health can help in preventing risk factors like constipation.
Renal Failure (Kidney Failure),A condition in which the kidneys lose the ability to remove waste and balance fluids. It can be acute (sudden) or chronic (occurring over time).,"Acute kidney failure can be caused by a sudden event that damages the kidneys, such as an injury, severe dehydration, or a severe infection. Chronic kidney failure is most often caused by long-term diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes.","Symptoms of chronic kidney failure develop slowly and may not be apparent until the disease is advanced. They can include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, swelling in the ankles and feet, and changes in urination.","The best way to prevent chronic kidney failure is to manage the underlying conditions that cause it. This includes controlling blood pressure and blood sugar, not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and using medications like NSAIDs cautiously.","**Disclaimer:** Kidney failure is a serious condition requiring management by a nephrologist. Treatment options include dialysis or a kidney transplant. Home care involves strictly following dietary restrictions (often limiting salt, potassium, and phosphorus) and fluid intake limits prescribed by the doctor.",Chronic kidney disease often has no symptoms in its early stages. That's why screening is important for people with risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure. Early detection can help slow the progression of the disease.,"WHO addresses kidney failure as part of its global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The strategy focuses on managing the main drivers of chronic kidney disease, namely diabetes and hypertension."
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection,"A common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults.","RSV is a contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also survive on surfaces, so it can be picked up by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face.","In adults and older children, symptoms are usually those of a common cold: runny nose, sore throat, cough, and headache. In young infants, it can cause more severe illness like bronchiolitis or pneumonia, with symptoms like wheezing and difficulty breathing.","To prevent RSV, wash your hands often, avoid touching your face, clean frequently touched surfaces, and avoid close contact with sick people. There is now a vaccine available for older adults and an antibody product to protect infants.","**Disclaimer:** Severe RSV requires medical attention. For mild cases, treatment is supportive. Use a cool-mist humidifier, saline nasal drops to clear congestion, and ensure the person (especially an infant) stays hydrated. Over-the-counter pain and fever reducers can be used.",RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. Almost all children will have had an RSV infection by their second birthday.,WHO monitors RSV disease burden globally and supports research and development of vaccines and therapeutics. They provide guidance to countries on surveillance and prevention strategies for this important respiratory pathogen.
Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS),"A condition that causes an uncontrollable urge to move your legs, usually because of an uncomfortable sensation. It typically happens in the evening or nighttime hours when you're sitting or lying down. Moving eases the unpleasant feeling temporarily.","The cause is often unknown. In some cases, it may be due to a genetic component. It can also be caused or worsened by other conditions, such as iron deficiency, kidney failure, or neuropathy. Pregnancy can also trigger RLS.","The hallmark symptom is an overwhelming urge to move the legs, accompanied by unpleasant crawling, creeping, or pulling sensations. Symptoms are worse at rest, especially in the evening, and are relieved by movement.","There's no definite prevention. However, certain lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms. This includes avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco. Establishing a regular sleep pattern is also important.","**Disclaimer:** RLS should be evaluated by a doctor to rule out underlying causes like iron deficiency. Home management includes taking warm baths, massaging the legs, and applying warm or cool packs. Regular, moderate exercise and leg stretches can also provide relief.","RLS can interfere with sleep, leading to daytime sleepiness and fatigue. It can significantly impact quality of life. It is a real neurological disorder, not just 'nervousness.'","WHO recognizes neurological disorders as a major cause of disability worldwide. While RLS is not a primary focus, WHO's work on promoting healthy lifestyles and managing underlying conditions like iron deficiency can help in the management of RLS symptoms."
Retinoblastoma,"A rare type of eye cancer that usually develops in early childhood, typically before the age of 5. It begins in the retina, the sensitive lining on the inside of your eye.",Retinoblastoma occurs when nerve cells in the retina develop genetic mutations. These mutations cause the cells to grow and multiply out of control. It can be inherited from a parent or occur sporadically without any family history.,"The most common sign is a white glow in the pupil (leukocoria), which is most often noticed in photographs taken with a flash. Other signs can include crossed eyes (strabismus), poor vision, and redness or swelling of the eye.","There is no known way to prevent retinoblastoma. For families with a known history of the disease, genetic counseling and regular eye exams for children from birth can help detect the cancer at its earliest, most treatable stage.",**Disclaimer:** Retinoblastoma is a serious cancer that requires specialized medical treatment from an ophthalmologist and oncologist. There are no home remedies. The goal of treatment is to cure the cancer while saving as much vision as possible.,Retinoblastoma has a very high cure rate (over 95%) if it is diagnosed and treated early while the cancer is still within the eye. Awareness of the 'white glow' in photos is crucial for early detection by parents.,"WHO, through initiatives like the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer, aims to improve outcomes for children with cancer worldwide. This includes promoting early diagnosis, access to quality treatment, and supportive care for rare childhood cancers like retinoblastoma."
Rheumatic Fever,"An inflammatory disease that can develop as a complication of inadequately treated strep throat or scarlet fever. It can cause permanent damage to the heart, known as rheumatic heart disease.","It is caused by an autoimmune reaction to an infection with group A streptococcus bacteria. The body's immune system, while fighting the strep infection, mistakenly attacks its own tissues, particularly in the heart, joints, brain, and skin.","Symptoms include fever, painful and tender joints (arthritis), fatigue, and sometimes a characteristic rash or small, painless nodules under the skin. The most serious symptom is inflammation of the heart (carditis), which can be life-threatening.",The only way to prevent rheumatic fever is to treat strep throat and scarlet fever infections promptly and thoroughly with a full course of antibiotics as prescribed by a doctor.,"**Disclaimer:** Rheumatic fever requires immediate medical treatment with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications. Home care is supportive, involving strict bed rest as advised by the doctor to reduce the strain on the heart, and following all medication schedules.",Rheumatic fever is most common in children aged 5 to 15. It is rare in developed countries but remains a significant problem in many developing nations. The heart damage it causes can lead to serious health problems later in life.,"WHO works to prevent and control rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, particularly in low-resource settings. Their strategy focuses on the primary prevention (treating strep throat) and secondary prevention (long-term antibiotics for those who've had rheumatic fever) to prevent heart damage."
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA),"A chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart, and blood vessels. It is an autoimmune disorder.","RA occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. It attacks the lining of your joints (synovium), causing painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The exact cause is unknown, but genetics and environmental triggers are involved.","Symptoms include tender, warm, swollen joints, joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite. RA typically affects joints on both sides of the body (symmetrically).","There is no known way to prevent RA. However, some factors, like smoking, are associated with a higher risk. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is beneficial for overall health but is not proven to prevent RA.","**Disclaimer:** RA requires management by a rheumatologist. Home care can help manage symptoms. Low-impact exercise (like swimming) can improve range of motion. Applying cold packs can reduce inflammation during flares, while heat can help relax muscles. A balanced diet and stress management are also important.","Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, meaning it can affect the whole body. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial to control the disease, relieve symptoms, and prevent joint damage and long-term disability.","WHO recognizes the significant burden of musculoskeletal conditions like RA. It promotes access to early diagnosis, effective treatments (including affordable biologic drugs), and rehabilitation services to improve the quality of life for people living with RA."
Rickets,A condition in children that results in soft and weakened bones. It is caused by an extreme and prolonged deficiency of vitamin D.,"The body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium and phosphorus from food. A lack of vitamin D makes it difficult to maintain proper calcium and phosphorus levels in bones, which can cause rickets. It can also be caused by rare genetic or kidney diseases.","Signs and symptoms can include delayed growth, pain in the spine, pelvis and legs, muscle weakness, and skeletal deformities such as bowed legs, thickened wrists and ankles, and breastbone projection.","Preventing rickets involves ensuring that children get enough vitamin D and calcium. This can come from sun exposure (which helps the body produce vitamin D), foods rich in vitamin D and calcium (like fortified milk and fatty fish), and supplements if recommended by a doctor.","**Disclaimer:** Rickets must be diagnosed and treated by a healthcare provider, usually with vitamin D and calcium supplements. Home care involves providing a diet rich in these nutrients. Following the doctor's instructions for supplementation is crucial.","Rickets was once common but became rare in developed countries due to the fortification of milk and other foods with vitamin D. However, it is still seen, especially in breastfed infants who are not given vitamin D supplements.","WHO addresses rickets as part of its global nutrition strategies, which focus on preventing micronutrient deficiencies. They provide guidelines on vitamin D and calcium intake for infants and children to prevent deficiency-related diseases."
Ringworm (Tinea Infection),"A common skin infection that is caused by a fungus, not a worm. It's called 'ringworm' because it can cause a circular, ring-shaped rash that is usually red and itchy.","It is caused by a type of fungus called dermatophytes. The infection is contagious and can be spread through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person or animal, or by touching contaminated objects like towels, clothing, or floors.","Symptoms depend on the location of the infection. On the skin (tinea corporis), it causes a red, itchy, circular rash. On the scalp (tinea capitis), it can cause scaly patches and hair loss. On the feet, it's called athlete's foot (tinea pedis).","To prevent ringworm, keep your skin clean and dry. Avoid sharing personal items like towels, combs, and clothing. Wear shoes in public showers and locker rooms. If you have a pet, check them for signs of ringworm (patches of missing fur).","Over-the-counter antifungal creams, lotions, or powders are usually effective for ringworm on the skin. It is important to continue treatment for the recommended time, even if the rash disappears, to ensure the fungus is gone. For scalp ringworm, prescription oral medication is needed.",Ringworm is a common and treatable fungal infection. Good hygiene is the best way to prevent it from spreading. It is important to treat it properly to prevent it from spreading to other parts of your body or to other people.,"WHO includes fungal infections like ringworm in its surveillance of communicable diseases. Public health guidance focuses on hygiene, sanitation, and the availability of effective antifungal treatments."
Rosacea,"A common skin condition that causes redness and visible blood vessels in your face. It may also produce small, red, pus-filled bumps. These signs and symptoms may flare up for weeks to months and then go away for a while.","The cause of rosacea is unknown, but it could be due to a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. A number of factors can trigger or aggravate rosacea by increasing blood flow to the surface of your skin. Triggers include hot drinks, spicy foods, alcohol, sunlight, and stress.","Symptoms include facial redness or flushing, visible blood vessels (telangiectasia), swollen red bumps (which may contain pus), and eye problems (ocular rosacea). In some cases, rosacea can cause the skin on the nose to thicken (rhinophyma).","There is no way to prevent rosacea, but you can control symptoms by identifying and avoiding your personal triggers. Sun protection is very important, as sunlight is a common trigger. Gentle skin care is also key.","**Disclaimer:** A dermatologist should manage rosacea. Home care involves using a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser and a good moisturizer. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen daily. Learning and avoiding personal triggers is the most important self-care step.","Rosacea can be mistaken for acne or other skin problems. It is a chronic condition with no cure, but treatments and lifestyle changes can help control and reduce the signs and symptoms and prevent it from getting worse.","WHO does not have specific programs for rosacea but includes it in the broad category of dermatological conditions. Their work on promoting healthy environments (e.g., protection from UV radiation) can be beneficial for people with rosacea."
Rubella (German Measles),"A contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash. It is generally a mild illness in children and adults. However, it is very dangerous for a pregnant woman's developing baby.","It is caused by the rubella virus. It spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with respiratory secretions.","Symptoms are often mild and may include a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Swollen lymph nodes behind the ears and in the neck are common.",The best protection against rubella is the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The vaccine is safe and highly effective. Vaccination is especially important for women of childbearing age to prevent congenital rubella syndrome.,"**Disclaimer:** A doctor should diagnose rubella. Treatment is supportive, as there is no specific medication. Rest and over-the-counter medications for fever or aches can help. Infected individuals should stay away from others, especially pregnant women, to prevent spread.","The greatest danger from rubella is Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS), which can occur when a pregnant woman is infected. CRS can cause severe birth defects, including deafness, cataracts, heart defects, and developmental delay in the unborn baby.",WHO strongly advocates for rubella vaccination to be included in all national immunization programs to prevent CRS. They lead global surveillance and support vaccination campaigns as part of the Measles & Rubella Initiative.
Salmonella Infection,A common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through feces. Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food.,"It is caused by Salmonella bacteria. People are usually infected by eating raw or undercooked meat, poultry, and eggs, or by consuming unpasteurized milk. It can also be spread through poor hygiene (not washing hands after using the bathroom).","Symptoms usually begin 12 to 72 hours after infection and include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Most healthy people recover within a few days to a week without specific treatment.","To prevent salmonella, cook poultry, ground beef, and eggs thoroughly. Avoid eating raw eggs or unpasteurized dairy products. Wash hands, kitchen surfaces, and utensils with soap and water after they have been in contact with raw meat or poultry.",**Disclaimer:** Most cases resolve on their own. The main focus is on replacing fluids and electrolytes lost through diarrhea to prevent dehydration. Oral rehydration solutions are recommended. Medical attention is needed if there are signs of severe dehydration or if the infection spreads.,"While most people recover fully, some may develop complications like reactive arthritis. The infection can be more serious in young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, and may require antibiotics.","WHO works to prevent and control foodborne diseases like salmonellosis through its 'farm to table' safety initiatives. This includes setting international food safety standards, promoting safe food handling education, and strengthening disease surveillance systems."
Sarcoidosis,An inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of tiny collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas) in any part of your body â most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes.,"The exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. It's thought to be an immune system disorder, possibly triggered by an infection or exposure to something in the environment in people who are genetically predisposed.","Symptoms vary depending on which organs are affected. General symptoms include fatigue, fever, and weight loss. If it affects the lungs (the most common site), symptoms may include a persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain.","Because the cause is unknown, there is no way to prevent sarcoidosis. The goal is early diagnosis and management to control symptoms and prevent organ damage.","**Disclaimer:** Sarcoidosis requires management by a specialist, such as a pulmonologist or rheumatologist. There is no home remedy. A healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise is important for overall well-being. Avoiding smoking is crucial if the lungs are affected.","The course of sarcoidosis is variable. For many people, it goes away on its own. For others, it can be a chronic condition that lasts for years and causes organ damage. Treatment, often with corticosteroids, aims to reduce inflammation.","WHO does not have a specific program for sarcoidosis, as it is a relatively rare, non-communicable disease of unknown cause. However, its work on strengthening health systems contributes to better diagnosis and management of such complex conditions."
Scabies,An itchy skin condition caused by a tiny burrowing mite called Sarcoptes scabiei. The intense itching occurs in the area where the mite burrows. The urge to scratch may be especially strong at night.,"It is caused by an infestation of the human itch mite. The mites burrow into the top layer of skin to live and lay their eggs. Scabies is highly contagious and spreads quickly through close physical contact in a family, school, or nursing home.","The primary symptoms are intense itching, especially at night, and a pimple-like skin rash. The burrow tracks of the mite may sometimes be visible on the skin as tiny raised, crooked lines.","To prevent scabies, avoid direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person or with items such as their clothing or bedding. Prompt treatment of an infected person is crucial to prevent spread to others.","**Disclaimer:** Scabies must be treated with prescription medications (scabicides) that kill the mites. It will not go away on its own. It is essential to treat all members of the household and close contacts at the same time, even if they don't have symptoms. Wash all bedding and clothing in hot water.","Scabies is not a sign of poor hygiene. Anyone can get it. The itching is caused by an allergic reaction to the mites, their eggs, and their waste. It can take 4-6 weeks for symptoms to appear after the first infestation.","WHO recognizes scabies as a neglected tropical disease. It can lead to secondary bacterial infections like impetigo, which in turn can cause more serious complications like kidney disease. WHO works to map the global burden and promote access to affordable treatment."
Scarlet Fever,A bacterial illness that develops in some people who have strep throat. It's characterized by a bright red rash that covers most of the body. Scarlet fever is almost always accompanied by a sore throat and a high fever.,It is caused by the same type of bacteria that causes strep throat: group A Streptococcus. The bacteria release a toxin that produces the rash and red tongue. It spreads through respiratory droplets from an infected person's coughs or sneezes.,"Symptoms include a very red, sore throat, a fever of 101 F (38.3 C) or higher, and a red rash with a sandpaper-like feel. A flushed face with a pale ring around the mouth and a 'strawberry tongue' (red and bumpy) are also characteristic signs.",The best way to prevent scarlet fever is to prevent the spread of strep throat. Practice good hand hygiene. Do not share eating utensils or drinking glasses. A person with strep throat or scarlet fever should stay home from school or work to avoid spreading the infection.,"**Disclaimer:** Scarlet fever must be treated with a full course of antibiotics prescribed by a doctor. This is crucial to prevent serious long-term complications like rheumatic fever. Home care includes rest, drinking fluids, and using a cool-mist humidifier.","With antibiotic treatment, scarlet fever is no longer the dangerous disease it once was. However, it is essential to complete the entire course of antibiotics to prevent the bacteria from causing complications, especially rheumatic fever which can damage the heart.","WHO's strategies to combat group A streptococcal infections, including the promotion of prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment for strep throat, are key to preventing scarlet fever and its severe complication, rheumatic fever."
Schizophrenia,"A serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.","The exact cause is unknown, but a combination of genetics, brain chemistry (an imbalance of neurotransmitters like dopamine), and environmental factors is believed to contribute to the development of the disorder.","Symptoms are categorized as 'positive' (hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders), 'negative' (reduced expression of emotions, lack of motivation), and 'cognitive' (problems with attention, concentration, and memory).","There is no known way to prevent schizophrenia. However, early diagnosis and treatment can help get symptoms under control before serious complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook. Recognizing the early warning signs is key.","**Disclaimer:** Schizophrenia requires lifelong treatment, even when symptoms have subsided. Treatment, usually managed by a psychiatrist, involves a combination of medications (antipsychotics) and psychosocial therapy. A stable home environment and strong family support are critical.",Schizophrenia is not a split personality. It is a chronic and severe mental illness. Stigma and misunderstanding can be major barriers to treatment and recovery. People with schizophrenia are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators.,"WHO's Mental Health Action Plan works to transform services for mental health globally. It advocates for community-based care, protection of human rights, and evidence-based treatment for people with severe mental disorders like schizophrenia."
Scoliosis,"A sideways curvature of the spine that occurs most often during the growth spurt just before puberty. While scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most childhood scoliosis is unknown.","Most cases are idiopathic, meaning they have no known cause. It tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic link. Less common types may be caused by neuromuscular conditions, birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine, or injuries to the spine.","The most common signs are uneven shoulders, one shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other, an uneven waist, and one hip higher than the other. Back pain is not a common symptom in adolescents.",There is no known way to prevent the most common type of scoliosis. Early detection through school screening programs or regular check-ups can help identify the condition so it can be monitored.,"**Disclaimer:** Scoliosis is managed by an orthopedic specialist. Treatment depends on the severity of the curve and may include observation, bracing (to prevent the curve from getting worse), or surgery. Home care involves performing any prescribed exercises and wearing a brace as directed.","Most cases of scoliosis are mild and don't require treatment. However, severe scoliosis can be disabling. A severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly.","WHO does not have a specific program for scoliosis, but it is covered under its broader work on child and adolescent health and disability. Promoting early screening and access to orthopedic care is part of strengthening overall health systems."
Sepsis,"A life-threatening medical emergency. It's your body's overwhelming and extreme response to an infection. The infection-fighting processes turn on the body, causing organs to work poorly.","Sepsis is caused by an infection anywhere in the body. The most common infections that lead to sepsis are lung infections like pneumonia, urinary tract infections, skin infections, and gut infections. Any infection can lead to sepsis.","There is no single sign or symptom. It's a combination of symptoms, including fever or low temperature, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion or disorientation, and extreme pain or discomfort.","The best way to prevent sepsis is to prevent infections. This includes getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene (hand washing), and getting prompt care if you develop signs of an infection. Managing chronic conditions also helps.","**Disclaimer:** Sepsis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment in a hospital, usually with intravenous antibiotics and fluids. There is no home treatment. It is critical to seek medical help immediately if sepsis is suspected.","Time matters in sepsis. The risk of death increases for every hour that treatment is delayed. Recognizing the early signs and seeking immediate care can save lives and improve outcomes. Anyone can get sepsis, but it's more common in the very young, the very old, and those with weakened immune systems.","WHO has made sepsis a global health priority. In 2017, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on improving the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. WHO provides guidance and tools to help countries improve sepsis care and reduce its devastating human and economic toll."
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs),"Infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. There are more than 30 different bacteria, viruses and parasites known to be transmitted sexually.","Caused by a variety of pathogens including bacteria (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis), viruses (e.g., HIV, herpes, HPV), and parasites (e.g., trichomoniasis). They are transmitted through contact with semen, vaginal fluids, blood, or skin-to-skin contact with an infected area.","Symptoms vary widely and can include sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area, painful urination, discharge from the penis or vagina, unusual vaginal bleeding, and pelvic pain. Many STIs have no symptoms.","The most reliable way to avoid infection is to abstain from sexual activity or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected. Consistent and correct use of condoms significantly reduces risk. Vaccination (e.g., for HPV and Hepatitis B) is also a key preventive measure.","**Disclaimer: STIs require medical diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics or antiviral medications.** There are no home remedies to cure STIs. Practicing safe sex, getting regular testing, and communicating openly with partners are essential parts of managing sexual health.","Many STIs are asymptomatic, so regular screening is crucial for anyone who is sexually active. Untreated STIs can lead to serious health complications like infertility, cancer, and increased risk of HIV transmission. Reducing stigma encourages testing and treatment.","WHO has a global health sector strategy on STIs aiming to end them as a public health concern. The strategy focuses on prevention through education and condoms, increased access to testing and diagnosis (including self-testing), and ensuring effective, affordable treatment."
Shigellosis,An infectious diarrheal disease caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella. It is very contagious and typically spreads in settings with poor hygiene.,"Caused by Shigella bacteria. It is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, either directly through person-to-person contact or indirectly through contaminated food, water, or surfaces. Only a very small number of bacteria are needed to cause an infection.","Diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after exposure. The illness usually resolves in 5 to 7 days.","The best prevention is frequent and thorough handwashing with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom and before preparing food. Avoid swallowing water from ponds, lakes, or untreated swimming pools. When traveling in high-risk areas, drink only boiled or bottled water.","**Disclaimer: Severe cases may require antibiotics. See a doctor if there is high fever or blood in the stool.** The main focus of home care is to prevent dehydration. Drink plenty of fluids like water, oral rehydration solutions (ORS), or broths. Avoid anti-diarrhea medications as they can make the illness worse.","Shigellosis is easily spread, especially among young children in daycare settings. Good hygiene is the cornerstone of prevention. Awareness of food and water safety is also critical in preventing outbreaks.","WHO lists shigellosis as a major cause of diarrheal disease globally. Its guidelines focus on improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) to prevent transmission. It also promotes the use of oral rehydration therapy to manage dehydration and provides guidance on antibiotic use for severe cases."
Shingles (Herpes Zoster),"A viral infection that causes a painful rash. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you've had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue near your spinal cord and brain. Years later, it may reactivate as shingles.","Reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus in someone who has previously had chickenpox. The reason for reactivation is not fully understood but is linked to a weakened immune system due to age, stress, illness, or certain medications.","Pain, burning, numbness or tingling is usually the first symptom, followed a few days later by a red rash. A single stripe of fluid-filled blisters that wraps around either the left or the right side of your torso is the hallmark sign. Fever, headache, and fatigue can also occur.","The most effective way to prevent shingles is to get the shingles vaccine (recombinant zoster vaccine), which is recommended for adults 50 and older. Maintaining a healthy immune system through good nutrition and stress management may also help.","**Disclaimer: Antiviral medication is most effective when started within 72 hours of the rash appearing.** Home care focuses on symptom relief. Cool compresses, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths can help relieve itching. Keep the rash clean and covered to prevent infection. Over-the-counter pain medication can help with discomfort.","You cannot catch shingles from someone who has it. However, a person with an active shingles rash can spread the varicella-zoster virus to someone who has never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, causing them to develop chickenpox. The vaccine is highly effective at preventing shingles and its most common complication, postherpetic neuralgia (long-term nerve pain).","WHO recommends the chickenpox vaccine as part of routine childhood immunization programs, which in turn reduces the number of people who can later develop shingles. It also provides guidance on the use of the shingles vaccine for older populations to prevent the disease and its complications."
Sickle Cell Anemia,"An inherited group of disorders that cause red blood cells to become misshapen (like a sickle or crescent moon) and break down. These cells die early, leaving a shortage of healthy red blood cells, and can block blood flow causing pain (sickle cell crises).","A genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene that tells the body to make hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. It is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning a person must inherit two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent.","Episodes of pain (pain crises), chronic fatigue due to anemia, swelling of hands and feet, frequent infections, delayed growth or puberty, and vision problems.","As a genetic disease, it cannot be prevented. Genetic counseling is important for carriers of the sickle cell trait who are planning to have children. Newborn screening is crucial for early diagnosis and management.","**Disclaimer: This is a serious chronic disease requiring lifelong medical supervision.** Home management involves preventing pain crises by avoiding triggers like dehydration, extreme temperatures, and over-exertion. Drinking plenty of fluids, taking prescribed medications like hydroxyurea, and using heating pads and over-the-counter pain relievers for mild pain are key.","Sickle cell anemia is a major global health problem, most common in people of African, Mediterranean, and South Asian descent. It is a lifelong illness, but with modern medical care, people can live longer, fuller lives. Blood donations from diverse communities are critically important for patients who require transfusions.","WHO recognizes sickle cell disease as a major public health issue and a priority noncommunicable disease. Its strategy focuses on supporting countries to develop national programs for prevention (genetic counseling), newborn screening, early diagnosis, and comprehensive care."
Sjogrenâs Syndrome,"An autoimmune disorder characterized by its two most common symptoms â dry eyes and a dry mouth. The condition often accompanies other immune system disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.","The cause is unknown, but it is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells, specifically the glands that produce tears and saliva. Genetic factors and potential viral triggers are thought to play a role.","The main symptoms are dry eyes (feeling like there's sand or grit in them) and dry mouth (difficulty swallowing or speaking). It can also cause fatigue, joint pain, and dryness in other areas like the skin and vagina. It may also damage other parts of thebody like the kidneys and lungs.",There is no known way to prevent Sjogren's syndrome. Early diagnosis and management are key to preventing complications like dental decay and eye damage.,"**Disclaimer: This condition requires medical management to control symptoms and prevent complications.** Home care includes sipping water frequently, chewing sugar-free gum or using saliva substitutes for dry mouth, and using over-the-counter artificial tears for dry eyes. A humidifier can add moisture to the air. Meticulous dental hygiene is essential to prevent cavities.","Sjogren's is a systemic disease that can affect the entire body. It is much more than just a nuisance of dry eyes and mouth. Awareness is important for early diagnosis, as symptoms can be mistaken for side effects of medication or aging.","WHO includes autoimmune diseases like Sjogren's syndrome under the umbrella of noncommunicable diseases. It promotes research and patient-centered care models for managing complex, chronic conditions that require multidisciplinary medical teams."
Skin Cancer,"The abnormal growth of skin cells, most often developing on skin exposed to the sun. The three major types are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.","The primary cause is overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or from artificial sources like tanning beds. Risk factors include fair skin, a history of sunburns, having many moles, and a family history of skin cancer.","Changes in the skin, such as a new growth, a sore that doesn't heal, or a change in an old mole. Look for the ABCDEs of melanoma: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color that is not uniform, Diameter greater than 6mm, and Evolving size, shape or color.","The most effective prevention is to limit or avoid exposure to UV radiation. Seek shade, especially during peak sun hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). Wear protective clothing, a broad-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Avoid tanning beds.",**Disclaimer: Any suspected skin cancer requires immediate medical evaluation and treatment.** Home care is focused on prevention and early detection. This involves performing regular self-exams of the skin to check for any new or changing spots.,"Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. Most cases are preventable. Early detection and treatment lead to excellent outcomes for most types of skin cancer, including melanoma. Regular skin checks by a dermatologist are recommended for high-risk individuals.","WHO recognizes skin cancer as a significant public health issue caused by UV radiation. It promotes public awareness campaigns like the SunSmart program, which educates people on sun protection measures to reduce the incidence of skin cancer globally."
Smallpox,"An acute, contagious, and sometimes fatal infectious disease caused by the variola virus. It was characterized by a distinctive rash of bumps on the skin.","Caused by the variola virus. It was spread through direct, prolonged, face-to-face contact between people, or through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing.","Fever, malaise, head and body aches, and sometimes vomiting. A few days later, a rash emerges, starting as small red spots on the tongue and in the mouth, which then break open. The rash then spreads to the skin, progressing through stages of raised bumps, fluid-filled blisters, and then crusted scabs.","The disease has been eradicated globally, so no precautions are currently necessary for the general public. Prevention was achieved through a highly effective vaccine. Research with the virus is now restricted to two high-security laboratories in the world.","**Disclaimer: Smallpox has been eradicated and no longer occurs naturally.** Treatment was supportive, as there was no specific cure. In the event of a re-emergence, antiviral drugs have been developed and stockpiled, and there are sufficient vaccine stockpiles for a global response.",The eradication of smallpox is one of the greatest achievements of public health in history. It demonstrates the power of global cooperation and vaccination. It was officially declared eradicated in 1980.,WHO led the global campaign that successfully eradicated smallpox. This remains a landmark achievement. WHO now maintains an emergency stockpile of smallpox vaccine and manages the oversight of the remaining virus stocks for research purposes.
Spina Bifida,A type of birth defect called a neural tube defect. It occurs when the neural tube (which becomes the brain and spinal cord) does not close completely during early pregnancy. This can result in damage to the spinal cord and nerves.,"The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. A key risk factor is a deficiency of folic acid (a B vitamin) before and during the very early stages of pregnancy.","Symptoms vary depending on the type and severity. They can range from minor physical problems with no symptoms to severe physical and intellectual disabilities. Common issues include weakness or paralysis of the legs, bowel and bladder control problems, and an accumulation of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus).","The most important preventive measure is for women of childbearing age to take a daily supplement containing 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid, starting at least one month before and continuing through the first trimester of pregnancy.","**Disclaimer: Spina bifida is a complex medical condition requiring lifelong care from a multidisciplinary team.** There are no home remedies. Home care involves managing the specific disabilities, such as performing clean intermittent catheterization for bladder issues, managing bowel programs, and caring for skin to prevent pressure sores.","With proper medical care, children born with spina bifida can lead active and productive lives. Awareness of the importance of folic acid for all women who could become pregnant is a critical public health message.",WHO strongly recommends the mandatory fortification of staple foods like wheat flour with folic acid as a safe and effective public health intervention to prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects. It also provides guidelines on folic acid supplementation for women.
Stomach Cancer (Gastric Cancer),Cancer that forms in the lining of the stomach. It tends to develop slowly over many years.,"The leading cause is long-term infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria. Other major risk factors include smoking, a diet high in smoked, pickled, or salty foods, and a family history of stomach cancer.","Early-stage stomach cancer rarely causes symptoms. Later symptoms can include indigestion and heartburn, feeling bloated after eating, nausea, stomach pain, and unintentional weight loss.","Prevention includes treating H. pylori infection, not smoking, and eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in salty and smoked foods. Maintaining a healthy weight also helps.","**Disclaimer: Cancer requires immediate medical treatment.** Home care during and after treatment is supportive. It may involve eating smaller, more frequent meals to manage bloating and nausea, and following specific dietary advice from a dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition.","Because early symptoms are vague and often ignored, stomach cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Awareness of risk factors and seeking medical advice for persistent indigestion, especially for those over 55, is important for earlier diagnosis.",WHO identifies H. pylori infection as a primary cause of stomach cancer and supports strategies for its detection and eradication in high-risk populations. Its cancer prevention guidelines also strongly emphasize tobacco control and healthy dietary patterns.
Strep Throat,"A bacterial infection in the throat and the tonsils. The throat gets irritated and inflamed, causing a sudden, severe sore throat.","Caused by infection with a bacterium called Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A streptococcus. It spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.","A sore throat that usually starts very quickly, pain when swallowing, fever, red and swollen tonsils sometimes with white patches or streaks of pus, tiny red spots (petechiae) on the roof of the mouth, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.","Wash hands frequently and thoroughly. Do not share eating utensils, drinking glasses, or other personal items with someone who is sick. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.",**Disclaimer: Strep throat should be treated with antibiotics to prevent complications.** Home care can relieve symptoms. Gargle several times a day with warm salt water (1/2 teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of water). Drink warm liquids like lemon tea or tea with honey. Use a cool-mist humidifier. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can reduce pain and fever.,"It is important to see a doctor for a sore throat with fever to determine if it's strep. Unlike a viral sore throat, strep throat needs antibiotics to prevent serious but rare complications like rheumatic fever (which can damage the heart) and kidney disease.","WHO addresses group A streptococcal infections as a significant cause of preventable illness and death, particularly from complications like acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Guidelines focus on accurate diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic stewardship to prevent both complications and antibiotic resistance."
Stroke,"A medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die in minutes.","There are two main causes: an ischemic stroke, caused by a blocked artery (due to a blood clot), and a hemorrhagic stroke, caused by a leaking or bursting blood vessel. Key risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and obesity.","Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body. Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding speech. Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes. Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or lack of coordination. Sudden severe headache with no known cause.","The best way to prevent a stroke is to manage its risk factors. This includes controlling high blood pressure, not smoking, managing diabetes, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a diet low in saturated fat and salt, and getting regular exercise.","**Disclaimer: A stroke is a medical emergency. Call emergency services immediately.** There are no home treatments for an acute stroke. Post-stroke care at home involves adhering to a rehabilitation plan (physical, occupational, and speech therapy), taking prescribed medications to prevent another stroke, and making long-term lifestyle changes.","Recognizing the signs of a stroke and acting F.A.S.T. (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call emergency services) is critical. Immediate medical treatment can minimize the long-term effects of a stroke and even prevent death. ""Time is brain.""","WHO identifies stroke as a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Its strategy for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) focuses heavily on the prevention and control of major risk factors like hypertension, tobacco use, and unhealthy diets to reduce the global burden of stroke."
Syphilis,"A bacterial infection that is usually spread through sexual contact. The disease starts as a painless sore â typically on the genitals, rectum or mouth. It can progress through distinct stages if left untreated.","Caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is passed from person to person through direct contact with a syphilitic sore (chancre) during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. It can also be passed from an infected mother to her unborn baby.","Primary stage: A single, painless sore (chancre). Secondary stage: Skin rash, swollen lymph nodes, and fever. Latent stage: No signs or symptoms. Tertiary stage: Can cause serious damage to the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, and other organs.",Abstaining from sexual contact or being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner are the surest ways to prevent syphilis. Consistent and correct use of condoms reduces the risk. Regular STI screening is important for sexually active individuals.,**Disclaimer: Syphilis is curable with antibiotics (typically penicillin) and requires medical treatment.** There are no home remedies to cure syphilis. It is crucial to complete the full course of treatment and to abstain from sexual contact until the infection is cleared. Partners must also be treated.,"Syphilis is often called 'the great imitator' because its symptoms can look like many other diseases. It is a serious disease that can have devastating consequences if not treated, but it is easy to cure with the right medicine. Congenital syphilis (passed to a baby during pregnancy) is a severe, preventable condition.",WHO's global strategy for sexually transmitted infections aims to eliminate congenital syphilis as a public health problem. It promotes universal screening of pregnant women and prompt treatment for those who are infected to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma),"A group of rare, chronic autoimmune diseases that involve the hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues. 'Sclero' means hard, and 'derma' means skin. In the systemic form, it can affect internal organs.","The cause is unknown, but it's an autoimmune condition. It involves an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in the body. The immune system is thought to trigger this process in genetically susceptible individuals.","Symptoms vary greatly. Common features include thickening and hardening of the skin, Raynaud's phenomenon (fingers and toes turning white and blue in the cold), joint pain, and heartburn. In severe cases, it can lead to scarring of the lungs, kidneys, and digestive tract.",There is no known way to prevent scleroderma. Early diagnosis is key to managing symptoms and monitoring for organ involvement.,"**Disclaimer: This is a complex disease requiring specialized medical care.** Home care focuses on managing symptoms. Regular stretching and physical therapy can maintain joint flexibility. Using moisturizers can help with skin tightness. Protecting hands and feet from the cold is crucial for Raynaud's. Eating small, frequent meals can help with digestive issues.","Scleroderma is more than just a skin condition; it can be a life-threatening systemic disease. Public awareness is low, which can lead to delayed diagnosis. Support groups are very important for patients to share experiences and coping strategies.",WHO classifies scleroderma under the broad category of musculoskeletal and autoimmune conditions. It supports research into these complex diseases and advocates for integrated care models that provide patients with access to the various specialists needed for management.
Tetanus,A serious bacterial infection that causes painful muscle spasms and can lead to death. It is often called 'lockjaw' because the jaw muscles are often the first to be affected.,"Caused by the toxin of the bacterium Clostridium tetani. The bacteria's spores are found in soil, dust, and animal feces. They can enter the body through deep cuts, puncture wounds, or burns. It is not spread from person to person.","The most common sign is a stiff jaw (lockjaw), followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty swallowing, and stiffness of the abdominal muscles. It can progress to painful body spasms triggered by minor things like a draft, a loud noise, or physical touch.","The best way to prevent tetanus is to be up-to-date with the tetanus vaccine. The DTaP vaccine is given to children, and adults need a tetanus booster shot every 10 years. Proper and immediate wound care for any cut or puncture is also essential.","**Disclaimer: Tetanus is a medical emergency requiring hospitalization.** There are no home remedies. Treatment involves administering a tetanus antitoxin, antibiotics, and drugs to control muscle spasms. Meticulous wound care is also performed.","Tetanus is a vaccine-preventable disease. In many parts of the world, neonatal tetanus (affecting newborns of unvaccinated mothers, often through an unhygienic umbilical cord cut) remains a problem. The vaccine is safe and highly effective.",WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) includes the tetanus vaccine as a core component of routine immunizations worldwide. A major global health goal has been the elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus through vaccination of pregnant women and clean delivery practices.
Thalassemia,An inherited blood disorder that causes the body to have less hemoglobin than normal. Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This leads to anemia.,Caused by mutations in the DNA of cells that make hemoglobin. These mutations are passed from parents to children. The severity of the disease depends on the number of gene mutations inherited.,"Symptoms depend on the type and severity. Mild thalassemia may have no symptoms. More severe forms cause fatigue, weakness, pale or yellowish skin, slow growth, dark urine, and abdominal swelling.","As a genetic disorder, thalassemia cannot be prevented. Genetic counseling and carrier screening are important for couples at risk of having a child with the disease, especially in populations where the gene is common (e.g., Mediterranean, South Asian).","**Disclaimer: Moderate to severe thalassemia requires regular medical treatment, often including blood transfusions and chelation therapy.** Home care for those with the disease includes following a healthy diet (but avoiding iron-rich foods or supplements unless advised), taking folic acid supplements, and avoiding infections by practicing good hygiene and getting all recommended vaccines.",Thalassemia is a chronic disease that requires lifelong management. Awareness about carrier screening before marriage or pregnancy can help reduce the incidence of severe forms of the disease. Blood donations are life-saving for patients who need regular transfusions.,"WHO recognizes thalassemia as a significant genetic disorder and supports countries in establishing national control programs. These programs include public awareness campaigns, carrier screening, genetic counseling, and ensuring access to comprehensive medical care for patients."
Thyroid Cancer,"A cancer that starts in the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck. It is responsible for producing hormones that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and weight.","The exact cause is not known. Risk factors include exposure to high levels of radiation (especially in childhood), having a family history of thyroid cancer, and certain genetic syndromes.","The most common sign is a lump or nodule in the neck that can be felt through the skin. Other symptoms can include changes to the voice, including increasing hoarseness; difficulty swallowing; and pain in the neck and throat.",Most cases cannot be prevented. Avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure is one known preventive measure. People with a family history of medullary thyroid cancer can be tested for the specific gene mutation and may opt for preventive surgery.,"**Disclaimer: Cancer requires immediate medical treatment.** Home care after surgery or treatment is focused on recovery. This includes taking thyroid hormone replacement medication as prescribed for life, and monitoring calcium levels if the parathyroid glands were affected.","Thyroid cancer is one of the more curable types of cancer, especially when found early. Most thyroid nodules are benign (not cancerous), but any lump in the neck should be evaluated by a doctor. Self-checks of the neck can aid in early detection.","WHO includes thyroid cancer in its global cancer surveillance data (GLOBOCAN). Its strategies for cancer control emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, access to effective treatment (surgery, radioactive iodine), and long-term follow-up care."
Tired Eyes,"Discomfort, weakness, or aching in or around the eyes. It is a common condition that occurs when your eyes get tired from intense use. Also known as eye strain or asthenopia.","Caused by prolonged periods of focusing on a task, such as reading, driving long distances, or, most commonly, looking at digital screens without taking breaks.","Sore, tired, burning, or itching eyes; watery or dry eyes; blurred or double vision; headache; and increased sensitivity to light.","Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Adjust lighting to reduce glare. Blink more often. Keep your screen at a comfortable distance.","Lavender oil offers gentle relief for tired and strained eyes. Add a drop of lavender oil to 500 ml (2Â½ cups) of water and shake the solution well. Dip two cotton wool pads in the liquid, squeeze out the excess water and place one pad over each eye. If you wear contact lenses, they must be removed beforehand.","Tired eyes can be very uncomfortable, but it is not a serious condition and does not cause permanent damage to your eyes. Rest is the most effective treatment.",WHO's 'World report on vision' acknowledges the increasing prevalence of digital eye strain due to modern lifestyles. It promotes good visual hygiene and regular eye check-ups to rule out underlying vision problems that can exacerbate strain.
Tonsillitis,"An inflammation of the tonsils, which are the two oval-shaped pads of tissue at the back of the throat.","Tonsillitis is most often caused by common viruses, but bacterial infections can also be the cause. The most common bacterium causing tonsillitis is Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus), the cause of strep throat.","Sore throat, red, swollen tonsils, white or yellow coating or patches on the tonsils, difficulty swallowing, fever, and swollen, tender lymph nodes in the neck.","The germs that cause tonsillitis are contagious. The best way to prevent it is to practice good hygiene. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoid sharing food, drinking glasses, or utensils.","**Disclaimer: See a doctor to determine if it's bacterial (requiring antibiotics) or viral.** For home relief of symptoms, get plenty of rest. Drink warm liquids to soothe the throat. Gargle with warm salt water several times a day. Use a cool-air humidifier to eliminate dry air that may further irritate the throat.","Most cases of tonsillitis, especially in young children, are caused by viruses and do not require antibiotics. It's important to differentiate from strep throat. Recurrent, severe tonsillitis may require surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy).",WHO's guidelines on the rational use of antibiotics are highly relevant to tonsillitis. Promoting accurate diagnosis to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes helps prevent the overuse of antibiotics and combat antimicrobial resistance.
Tooth Decay (Dental Caries),"Damage to a tooth's surface, or enamel. It happens when bacteria in your mouth make acids that attack the enamel. If left untreated, it can lead to cavities (holes in the teeth), pain, infection, and even tooth loss.","Caused by the activity of certain species of bacteria that live in plaque on the teeth. These bacteria feed on sugars from food and drinks and produce acids as a waste product. These acids demineralize the tooth enamel. Frequent snacking, sugary drinks, and poor oral hygiene are major contributors.","Symptoms vary with severity. Early on, there may be no symptoms. As decay progresses, it can cause tooth sensitivity, mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold, visible holes or pits in your teeth, and brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth.",Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste. Floss daily to clean between teeth. Limit sugary foods and drinks. Visit your dentist regularly for checkups and professional cleanings. Consider dental sealants for children's molars.,"**Disclaimer: Once a cavity forms, it requires treatment by a dentist.** Home care is all about prevention. Maintaining excellent oral hygiene is the best home treatment. Rinsing the mouth with water after meals and snacks can help wash away food particles and sugars.","Tooth decay is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, yet it is largely preventable. It's not just a problem for children; adults can get cavities too. Good oral health is linked to good overall health.","WHO considers oral diseases, with dental caries being the most prominent, a major global public health problem. Its strategy focuses on promoting oral health through public health policies, such as fluoride use (in water, salt, or toothpaste) and encouraging reduced sugar intake."
Tourette Syndrome,"A neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics.","The exact cause is unknown. It is a complex disorder likely caused by a combination of inherited (genetic) and environmental factors. Abnormalities in certain brain regions and the neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin) that communicate between nerve cells are thought to play a role.","The primary symptoms are motor tics (e.g., eye blinking, head jerking, shoulder shrugging) and vocal tics (e.g., grunting, throat clearing, shouting words or phrases). Tics typically emerge between ages 3 and 9.",There is no known way to prevent Tourette syndrome. Genetic counseling may be helpful for families with a history of the disorder.,"**Disclaimer: Tourette syndrome is managed with medical and behavioral therapies; it is not cured.** Home management involves education for the family, teachers, and peers to foster understanding and acceptance. Reducing stress and avoiding fatigue can help lessen the severity of tics, as they often worsen under these conditions. Behavioral therapies like habit reversal training are key.",Tourette syndrome is not a psychological disorder or a sign of low intelligence. The tics are involuntary and people who have them cannot simply 'stop'. Public awareness and education are crucial to combat misconceptions and bullying.,"WHO classifies Tourette syndrome as a neurological disorder. Its mental health action plan promotes the integration of care for neurological and mental health conditions into primary healthcare settings, improving access to diagnosis and support for individuals and families."
Trichomoniasis,A very common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a parasite. It is considered the most common curable STI.,"Caused by infection with a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. The infection is spread through sexual contact, most commonly from a penis to a vagina, or from a vagina to a penis.","About 70% of infected people do not have any signs or symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can range from mild irritation to severe inflammation. Men may feel itching inside the penis or have some discharge. Women may notice itching, burning, or soreness of the genitals and a change in their vaginal discharge (e.g., thin with an unusual fishy smell).",Using condoms correctly and consistently during sex is the best way to prevent trichomoniasis. Being in a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner or abstaining from sex also prevents infection.,**Disclaimer: Trichomoniasis is treated with prescription antibiotic medication (usually metronidazole or tinidazole).** It is crucial that all sexual partners are treated at the same time to prevent reinfection. Abstain from sex until the infection is cleared (usually about a week after finishing treatment).,"Because it is often asymptomatic, many people don't know they have it and can pass it on to others. Untreated, it can increase the risk of getting or spreading other STIs, like HIV. It can also cause complications in pregnancy.",WHO includes trichomoniasis in its global strategy for controlling sexually transmitted infections. It emphasizes the importance of syndromic management (treating based on symptoms) in settings where lab tests are unavailable and promotes integrated services for sexual and reproductive health.
Tuberculosis (TB),A potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects the lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.,"Caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It spreads through the air when a person with active TB disease of the lungs coughs, speaks, or sneezes. Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick (this is called latent TB infection).","Symptoms of active TB disease include a persistent cough that lasts three weeks or longer, coughing up blood or mucus, chest pain, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, and chills.","A vaccine (BCG) is available and often given to infants in countries where TB is common. The best way to prevent the spread of active TB is for patients to take all of their medications as prescribed, cover their mouth and nose when coughing, and sometimes, stay home to avoid infecting others.","**Disclaimer: TB requires a long course of multiple antibiotics prescribed by a doctor.** Adherence to the full treatment regimen is critical to cure the disease and prevent the development of drug-resistant TB. Home care involves getting plenty of rest, eating a balanced diet, and taking medication exactly as directed.","TB remains one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases. There is a difference between latent TB (not sick, not infectious) and active TB disease. Drug-resistant TB is a major public health crisis that is more difficult and expensive to treat.","WHO leads the global effort to end the TB epidemic through its End TB Strategy. Key components include early diagnosis, standardized treatment regimens (like DOTS - Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course), prevention of drug resistance, and research into new vaccines, diagnostics, and drugs."
Tularemia,"A rare infectious disease that can attack the skin, eyes, lymph nodes, and lungs. It is caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis and is typically found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits, and hares.","Caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. Humans can become infected through several routes, including tick and deer fly bites, handling infected animal carcasses, consuming contaminated food or water, or inhaling the bacteria.","Symptoms vary depending on how the bacteria enter the body. They can include a skin ulcer at the site of infection, swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, headache, and exhaustion. If inhaled, it can cause a severe pneumonia.","When in areas where tularemia is present, use insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants, and avoid handling sick or dead animals. Cook game meat thoroughly before eating. Ensure your drinking water is from a safe source.","**Disclaimer: Tularemia requires treatment with specific antibiotics.** There are no home remedies to cure the infection. Home care is supportive, involving rest and hydration while the antibiotics work.","Tularemia is not known to be spread from person to person. Because of its high infectivity when aerosolized, F. tularensis is considered a potential bioterrorism agent, so awareness in the medical and public health communities is important.","WHO classifies Francisella tularensis as a highly infectious pathogen. It provides guidance to member states on laboratory biosafety and biosecurity, as well as surveillance and response protocols for potential outbreaks or deliberate release events."
Typhoid Fever,A life-threatening bacterial infection that is most common in developing countries where sanitation is poor and water may be contaminated.,Caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. It is spread through contaminated food and water or through close contact with an infected person. The bacteria are passed in the feces and sometimes in the urine of infected people.,"Sustained high fever, weakness, stomach pain, headache, loss of appetite, and sometimes a rash of flat, rose-colored spots. Some people experience constipation, while others have diarrhea.","Two main strategies: vaccination and avoiding risky food and water. Vaccines are available and recommended for travelers to endemic areas. Follow the rule: 'Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it.' Drink only bottled or boiled water. Practice diligent handwashing.",**Disclaimer: Typhoid fever must be treated with antibiotics.** Supportive care at home focuses on preventing dehydration caused by fever and diarrhea. Drink plenty of clean fluids. An oral rehydration solution (ORS) can be used. Eat nutritious food to regain strength.,"Typhoid fever is a serious public health problem in many parts of the world. 'Carriers' are people who recover from typhoid but continue to carry and shed the bacteria, posing a risk to others. Improved water and sanitation systems are the ultimate solution.","WHO prequalified two typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV) and recommends their introduction in countries with a high burden of the disease. It also works with countries to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure, which is the long-term solution for prevention."
Ulcerative Colitis (UC),A type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes long-lasting inflammation and ulcers (sores) in the innermost lining of your large intestine (colon) and rectum.,"The exact cause is unknown. It's believed to be the result of an abnormal immune system response. The immune system mistakes food, good gut bacteria, and the cells that line the colon as foreign invaders and attacks them, causing inflammation. Genetics also plays a role.","Symptoms can vary but often include diarrhea, frequently with blood or pus; abdominal pain and cramping; rectal pain; an urgent need to defecate; and weight loss. Symptoms often occur in flare-ups followed by periods of remission.","There's no known way to prevent UC. However, one can manage the disease and reduce flare-ups by taking medication as prescribed, managing stress, and identifying and avoiding personal food triggers.","**Disclaimer: UC requires long-term medical management.** During a flare, a low-residue diet might help reduce symptoms. Keeping a food diary can help identify trigger foods. Probiotics may benefit some. Stress-reduction techniques like yoga and meditation are very helpful as stress can trigger flares.","UC is a chronic, lifelong condition that is different from IBS or Crohn's disease. It can have a significant impact on quality of life. Awareness and education help reduce stigma and encourage people to seek proper medical care.",WHO addresses IBDs like ulcerative colitis within its framework for noncommunicable diseases. It supports patient-centered care models and research into the causes and treatments of these complex immune-mediated conditions.
Urethritis,"Inflammation of the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body.","It is most commonly caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. It can also be caused by bacteria from a urinary tract infection (UTI) or by injury from a urinary catheter.","The primary symptoms are pain or a burning sensation during urination (dysuria) and a discharge from the urethra. In men, there might be blood in the urine or semen.","To prevent STI-related urethritis, practice safe sex by using condoms consistently and correctly. Regular STI screening is also important. To prevent non-infectious urethritis, good personal hygiene can help.","**Disclaimer: Urethritis requires medical diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics.** It is important to complete the full course of medication. Drinking plenty of water can help flush out bacteria and dilute the urine, making urination less painful. Avoid sexual contact until the infection has cleared.","It is crucial to get urethritis treated promptly. If the cause is an STI, partners must also be treated to prevent reinfection and further spread. Untreated, it can lead to more serious infections of the bladder, testicles, or prostate.","WHO's global strategy on STIs directly addresses the prevention and management of conditions like urethritis. It promotes condom use, regular testing, and effective, accessible treatment to prevent complications and onward transmission."
Urinary Incontinence,"The loss of bladder control, resulting in the unintentional leakage of urine. It is a common and often embarrassing problem. The severity ranges from occasionally leaking urine when you cough or sneeze to having an urge to urinate that's so sudden and strong you don't get to a toilet in time.","Causes include weakened pelvic floor muscles (often due to pregnancy and childbirth), an overactive bladder, nerve damage, and prostate problems in men. It is more common with age but is not a normal part of aging.","The main symptom is the involuntary leakage of urine. Types include stress incontinence (leakage with pressure from coughing, sneezing, laughing), urge incontinence (a sudden, intense urge followed by leakage), and overflow incontinence (frequent or constant dribbling).","Maintaining a healthy weight, practicing pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegels), avoiding bladder irritants like caffeine and alcohol, and eating more fiber to prevent constipation can all help prevent or reduce incontinence.","**Disclaimer: See a doctor for diagnosis and to discuss treatment options.** Pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) are a very effective home treatment for stress incontinence. Bladder training, which involves delaying urination and setting a fixed voiding schedule, can help manage urge incontinence.","Urinary incontinence is a treatable medical condition, not an inevitable part of aging. Many people are too embarrassed to seek help, but effective treatments are available. Awareness can help de-stigmatize the condition and encourage people to see a doctor.","WHO's focus on healthy aging includes promoting strategies to manage and prevent age-related conditions that affect quality of life, such as urinary incontinence. It advocates for accessible primary care services where such issues can be addressed."
Urinary Tract Infection (UTI),"An infection in any part of the urinary system â the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract (the bladder and the urethra).","Caused by bacteria, most commonly Escherichia coli (E. coli) from the digestive tract, entering the urethra and multiplying in the bladder. Women are at greater risk due to their shorter urethra.","A strong, persistent urge to urinate; a burning sensation when urinating; passing frequent, small amounts of urine; urine that appears cloudy; urine that appears red, bright pink or cola-colored â a sign of blood in the urine; and pelvic pain in women.","Drink plenty of liquids, especially water, to dilute your urine and flush out bacteria. For women, wipe from front to back after using the toilet. Empty your bladder soon after intercourse. Avoid potentially irritating feminine products.","**Disclaimer: A UTI requires treatment with antibiotics.** To relieve symptoms while antibiotics work, drink plenty of water. A heating pad placed on the abdomen can soothe bladder pressure. Avoid coffee, alcohol, and soft drinks containing citrus juices or caffeine until your infection has cleared, as they can irritate your bladder.","UTIs are very common, especially in women. It's important to seek treatment to prevent the infection from spreading to the kidneys (pyelonephritis), which is a more serious condition. Some people experience recurrent UTIs, which requires further medical investigation.","WHO provides guidelines on the appropriate use of antibiotics for common infections like UTIs to combat the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. It also promotes improved hygiene and sanitation, which can help reduce the incidence of UTIs."
Urticaria (Hives),A skin reaction that causes itchy welts (wheals). The welts can vary in size and appear and fade repeatedly as the reaction runs its course. Hives are very common.,"Hives are usually caused by an allergic reaction to a substance, such as a food, medication, or insect sting. They can also be caused by non-allergic triggers like stress, sun exposure, cold, or viral infections. In many chronic cases, the cause is unknown (idiopathic).","Raised, itchy, red or skin-colored welts or bumps on the skin's surface. They can appear anywhere on the body. Blanching (the center of a hive turns white when pressed). The welts often change shape, move around, and disappear and reappear over short periods.","If you know what triggers your hives, avoiding that trigger is the best prevention. For example, if a certain food causes hives, don't eat it. Keeping a diary of symptoms and potential exposures can help identify triggers.","**Disclaimer: Seek immediate medical care for hives accompanied by difficulty breathing or swelling of the throat (anaphylaxis).** Over-the-counter antihistamines are the primary treatment. Soothe the skin with cool compresses or a cool bath with colloidal oatmeal. Wear loose, smooth-textured clothing.","Acute hives are very common and usually harmless, resolving within a few days. Chronic hives (lasting more than six weeks) can be very frustrating and significantly impact quality of life, often requiring ongoing management with a doctor or specialist.","WHO addresses allergic diseases as part of its work on noncommunicable diseases. It supports research into the causes of allergic reactions and promotes access to essential medicines, including antihistamines and epinephrine for severe reactions."
Uterine Cancer (Endometrial Cancer),"Cancer that begins in the uterus, the pear-shaped organ in a woman's pelvis where fetal development occurs. The most common type is endometrial cancer, which starts in the lining of the uterus (the endometrium).","The exact cause is unknown, but it's strongly linked to high levels of the hormone estrogen. Risk factors include obesity, diabetes, never having been pregnant, starting periods at an early age, late menopause, and taking estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy.","The most common symptom is abnormal vaginal bleeding, especially any bleeding after menopause. Other symptoms include bleeding between periods, pelvic pain, and pain during intercourse.","Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the most effective preventive strategies, as excess fat produces estrogen. Using a form of birth control that combines estrogen and progestin can also lower the risk. Discussing the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy with a doctor is important.","**Disclaimer: Cancer requires immediate medical treatment.** Home care is supportive, focusing on recovery after surgery or during radiation or chemotherapy. This includes managing pain, getting adequate rest, and maintaining good nutrition.",Uterine cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive system. The key to a good outcome is early detection. Any postmenopausal bleeding is abnormal and should be reported to a doctor immediately.,"WHO's global cancer initiatives focus on prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment for all cancers, including uterine cancer. It promotes policies to combat key risk factors like obesity and provides guidelines for the establishment of effective cancer screening and treatment programs."
Uveitis,"Inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of tissue in the eyewall. The uvea consists of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis can be serious, leading to permanent vision loss.","The cause is often unknown. However, in some cases it can be associated with an autoimmune disorder (like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus), an infection, or an injury to the eye.","Symptoms can come on suddenly and get worse quickly. They include eye redness, eye pain, light sensitivity, blurred vision, dark, floating spots in your field of vision (floaters), and decreased vision.",There is no known way to prevent most cases of uveitis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of any underlying systemic condition may help control eye inflammation.,**Disclaimer: Uveitis requires prompt evaluation and treatment by an ophthalmologist to prevent vision loss.** There are no home remedies to treat the inflammation. Home care involves diligently using prescribed eye drops (often steroids to reduce inflammation) and protecting the eyes from bright light with sunglasses.,"Uveitis is a medical emergency. Any combination of eye pain, severe light sensitivity, and blurry vision requires immediate attention from an eye doctor. Delays in treatment can lead to complications like glaucoma, cataracts, and permanent damage to the eye.",WHO's VISION 2020: The Right to Sight global initiative aims to eliminate the main causes of avoidable blindness. This includes ensuring access to specialized ophthalmology services for the diagnosis and treatment of potentially blinding conditions like uveitis.
Varicose Veins,"Gnarled, enlarged veins, most commonly appearing in the legs and feet. They are often blue or dark purple. For many people, they are simply a cosmetic concern, but for others, they can cause aching pain and discomfort.","Caused by weak or damaged valves in the veins. When these valves don't work properly, blood collects in the veins rather than continuing toward the heart. This pressure causes the veins to stretch and enlarge. Risk factors include age, being female, pregnancy, family history, and obesity.","Veins that are dark purple or blue in color; veins that appear twisted and bulging, like cords on your legs. Aching or heavy feeling in the legs, burning, throbbing, muscle cramping, and swelling in the lower legs. Pain that worsens after sitting or standing for a long time.","Exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a high-fiber, low-salt diet, elevating your legs, and avoiding long periods of standing or sitting can all help improve circulation and may prevent varicose veins from getting worse.","**Disclaimer: See a doctor for painful or bothersome varicose veins, as several treatment options are available.** Home care focuses on relieving symptoms. Regular exercise, especially walking, is key. Elevate your legs above the level of your heart for 15 minutes a few times a day. Compression stockings are very effective at improving blood flow and reducing swelling.","Varicose veins are very common. While often just a cosmetic issue, they can sometimes lead to more serious problems like ulcers, blood clots, or bleeding. It's important to see a doctor if they become painful or swollen.","WHO addresses conditions related to vascular health as part of its focus on noncommunicable diseases. Public health recommendations on physical activity, healthy diet, and weight management to prevent cardiovascular disease are also effective for preventing and managing varicose veins."
Vasculitis,"An umbrella term for a group of rare diseases that cause inflammation of the blood vessels. This inflammation can cause the walls of the blood vessels to thicken, which reduces the width of the passageway through the vessel. This can restrict blood flow, resulting in organ and tissue damage.","The exact cause is unknown. Some types are related to a person's genetic makeup. Others result from the immune system attacking blood vessel cells by mistake (autoimmune). Triggers can include an infection, like hepatitis B or C, or certain medications.","General signs and symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, weight loss, and general aches and pains. More specific symptoms depend on which blood vessels and organ systems are affected and can range from skin rashes to nerve problems or kidney failure.",There is no known way to prevent most types of vasculitis. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent permanent organ damage.,"**Disclaimer: Vasculitis is a serious condition that requires specialized medical treatment, often with steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs.** Home care is supportive. This includes adhering strictly to the medication regimen, getting adequate rest, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in appropriate exercise as advised by a doctor to maintain strength and flexibility.","Vasculitis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms are often non-specific. It can affect anyone, though some types are more common in certain age groups. Awareness within the medical community is key to timely diagnosis.",WHO supports research into rare diseases like vasculitis. It promotes international collaboration and the development of clinical guidelines to help standardize diagnosis and treatment for these complex conditions around the world.
Vitamin D Deficiency,A condition where there is not enough vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential for absorbing calcium and promoting bone growth. It also plays important roles in immune function and inflammation reduction.,"Caused by a lack of exposure to sunlight (the body makes vitamin D when skin is exposed to the sun), insufficient dietary intake of vitamin D, problems with absorption from the intestine, or the liver or kidneys being unable to convert vitamin D to its active form.","Often, there are no symptoms. When they do occur, symptoms can be subtle and include fatigue, bone pain, muscle weakness, muscle aches, or muscle cramps, and mood changes like depression. Severe deficiency can lead to rickets in children and osteomalacia (soft bones) in adults.","Get adequate, safe sun exposure (e.g., 10-30 minutes of midday sun on the arms and legs, a few times per week). Eat foods rich in or fortified with vitamin D, such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), fortified milk, and egg yolks.","**Disclaimer: Consult a doctor before starting supplements to determine the correct dosage.** The primary home treatment is to increase vitamin D levels through diet and safe sun exposure. Vitamin D supplements are widely used and effective, but should be taken based on a doctor's recommendation after a blood test.","Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem, affecting a large percentage of the population. People with darker skin, older adults, and those with limited sun exposure are at higher risk. It is associated with a range of health issues beyond just bone health.","WHO recognizes vitamin D deficiency as a significant public health issue, particularly for bone health. It provides guidelines on supplementation for at-risk groups like infants and pregnant women and supports national food fortification programs."
Vitiligo,"A long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. It's caused by the lack of melanin, which is the pigment in skin. Vitiligo can affect any area of skin, but it commonly happens on the face, neck and hands, and in skin creases.","Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the melanocytes, the skin cells that make melanin. A combination of genetic, and environmental factors is thought to trigger the disease.","The main sign is the appearance of milky-white, flat patches on the skin. It can start as a small patch and gradually get larger. The hair growing in affected areas may also turn white. It is not painful or itchy.","There is no known way to prevent vitiligo. Protecting the skin from the sun is very important for people with vitiligo, as the white patches have no natural protection and can burn very easily.","**Disclaimer: Medical treatments can help restore skin color, but there is no cure.** The most important home care is sun protection. Use a broad-spectrum, high-SPF sunscreen on all exposed skin. Cosmetic options, like camouflage makeup or self-tanning lotions, can be used to make the patches less noticeable.","Vitiligo is not contagious or life-threatening. However, it can have a significant impact on a person's emotional and psychological well-being due to its effect on appearance. Awareness and support can help combat social stigma.","WHO classifies vitiligo as a skin disease. While not a focus of major global programs, its work on mental health is relevant, as it advocates for psychological support for individuals living with chronic conditions that affect appearance and self-esteem."
Vulvar Cancer,"A rare type of cancer that occurs on the outer surface area of the female genitals (the vulva). The vulva includes the inner and outer lips of the vagina, the clitoris, and the opening of the vagina.","The exact cause isn't known. It's associated with infection with high-risk types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Other risk factors include smoking, having a weakened immune system, and a history of certain other skin conditions affecting the vulva.","Symptoms can include a lump, itching, pain or tenderness, bleeding not associated with menstruation, and skin changes, such as color changes or thickening.",The HPV vaccine can prevent infection with the types of HPV most commonly linked to vulvar cancer. Practicing safe sex reduces the risk of HPV. Not smoking is another important preventive measure. Regular gynecological exams can help detect precancerous changes.,"**Disclaimer: Cancer requires immediate medical treatment.** Home care is supportive, particularly after surgery or during other treatments. This can involve careful wound care (sitz baths may be recommended), pain management, and emotional support.","Vulvar cancer is rare, but it's important for women to be aware of the signs and symptoms. Any persistent itching, lump, or skin change on the vulva should be checked by a doctor. Self-examination can help in early detection.","WHO's global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer, which is also caused by HPV, has a broad impact. The promotion of HPV vaccination for girls is a key strategy that will also reduce the incidence of vulvar and other HPV-related cancers."
Warts,"Small, fleshy, grainy bumps that can grow on the skin. They are most common on the hands and feet. Warts are caused by a virus and are contagious.","Caused by various strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus is transmitted by casual skin-to-skin contact or through contact with a contaminated surface, like a shower floor. The virus enters the body through tiny cuts or scratches in the skin.","Fleshy, grainy skin growths. They are often rough to the touch. They may contain small black dots, which are clotted blood vessels. Common warts often appear on fingers and hands, while plantar warts appear on the soles of the feet.","Avoid touching or picking at warts (your own or someone else's). Don't share towels, razors, or other personal items. Wear shower shoes in public locker rooms and pool areas. Keep your feet dry, as warts thrive in moist environments.","**Disclaimer: See a doctor for warts that are painful, spreading, or on the face or genitals.** Many common warts go away on their own, though it can take a long time. Over-the-counter treatments containing salicylic acid can be effective. Covering the wart with duct tape for several days at a time is another popular home remedy, though its effectiveness is debated.","Warts are very common, especially in children. They are generally harmless but can be bothersome or embarrassing. It's important to know they are contagious and can be spread to other parts of your own body or to other people.","WHO's work on HPV is primarily focused on the high-risk strains that cause cancer. While common warts are caused by different, low-risk HPV strains, WHO's general health advice on hygiene and skin care is relevant to preventing the transmission of the virus."
West Nile Virus Infection,"A disease spread by mosquitoes that can cause fever and, in serious cases, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).",Caused by the West Nile virus. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds. The virus is not spread through casual person-to-person contact.,"Most people (about 80%) who are infected will not have any symptoms. Some people develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Less than 1% develop a serious neurologic illness like encephalitis or meningitis.","The best way to prevent infection is to avoid mosquito bites. Use insect repellent containing DEET, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and take steps to control mosquitoes indoors and outdoors by removing standing water where they can breed.","**Disclaimer: There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus infection. Severe cases require hospitalization.** For milder cases, home care involves rest, drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers to reduce fever and relieve aches.","The risk of infection is highest during mosquito season (summer through fall). While the risk of severe disease is low, it is higher for people over 60 and those with certain medical conditions. Public health surveillance of mosquitoes and birds is key to monitoring the virus.","WHO monitors the global distribution of West Nile virus and other arboviruses. It provides technical support and guidance to countries for surveillance, vector control, and outbreak response. It emphasizes an integrated 'One Health' approach, recognizing the link between human, animal, and environmental health."
Wilmsâ Tumor,A rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children. It is the most common type of kidney cancer in children.,"The exact cause is unknown. It is thought to occur when errors develop in the DNA of kidney cells, causing them to grow out of control. A small number of cases are linked to an inherited genetic syndrome.","The most common sign is a swelling or lump in the abdomen that can be felt. Other symptoms might include fever, pain in the abdomen, nausea, and blood in the urine.","There is no known way to prevent Wilms' tumor. For children with genetic syndromes that increase their risk, regular ultrasound screening of the kidneys may be recommended to detect any tumor early.","**Disclaimer: Wilms' tumor is a serious cancer requiring specialized pediatric cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation).** Home care is focused on supporting the child through treatment and recovery. This includes managing side effects like nausea, ensuring good nutrition, and providing emotional support.","Wilms' tumor has a very high cure rate, with more than 90% of children being cured. This success is a result of effective, collaborative clinical trials and multidisciplinary care. Awareness of a painless abdominal mass as a potential sign is important for parents.","WHO, through its Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer, aims to increase the survival rate of children with cancer to at least 60% globally by 2030. This involves strengthening health systems to ensure all children have access to accurate diagnosis, quality treatment, and supportive care for cancers like Wilms' tumor."
Wilsonâs Disease,"A rare inherited disorder that causes too much copper to accumulate in your organs, particularly the liver, brain, and eyes.","Caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is responsible for transporting excess copper out of the liver. When this protein is defective, copper builds up to toxic levels. It is an autosomal recessive disorder.","Symptoms depend on the organ affected. Liver-related signs include fatigue, jaundice, and fluid buildup. Neurological symptoms can include problems with speech, swallowing, or physical coordination, tremors, and stiff muscles. A hallmark sign is Kayser-Fleischer rings (golden-brown eye discoloration).","As a genetic disorder, it cannot be prevented. However, early diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious long-term complications. Screening of siblings of a diagnosed patient is crucial.","**Disclaimer: Wilson's disease requires lifelong medical treatment to remove excess copper and prevent its re-accumulation.** Home management involves strict adherence to medication (chelating agents like penicillamine or zinc supplements). Patients usually need to follow a low-copper diet, avoiding foods like shellfish, liver, nuts, and chocolate.","Wilson's disease is treatable, and people who receive treatment early can live full, healthy lives. However, if left untreated, it is fatal. The symptoms can be mistaken for other conditions, so awareness among physicians is important for diagnosis.",WHO supports research and information sharing on rare genetic diseases like Wilson's disease. It works to integrate the management of genetic disorders into national health plans and improve access to diagnostics and essential medicines.
Worm Infestation (Helminthiasis),"Infections of the body by parasitic worms (helminths). They are very common worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical areas with poor sanitation. Common types include roundworms, tapeworms, flukes, and hookworms.","Caused by ingesting worm eggs or larvae, often through contaminated food, water, or soil. Some worms can also enter through the skin. Poor sanitation and hygiene are the primary risk factors.","Symptoms vary depending on the type and burden of worms. Many infections are asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, weight loss, and anal itching (especially with pinworms).","The best prevention is good hygiene and sanitation. Wash hands with soap and water before eating and after using the toilet. Wash, peel, and cook all raw vegetables and fruits. Drink safe, clean water. Wear shoes when walking on soil where hookworm is common.",**Disclaimer: Worm infestations are treated with specific anti-parasitic medications prescribed by a doctor.** There are no proven home remedies to kill the worms. Home care is focused on prevention of re-infection for the entire family through meticulous hygiene.,"Soil-transmitted helminth infections are among the most common infections worldwide and affect the poorest and most deprived communities. They can impair nutritional status, growth, and cognitive development in children.","WHO leads global programs to control soil-transmitted helminthiasis, classifying it as a neglected tropical disease. The main strategy is large-scale, regular deworming of at-risk populations (especially children), combined with health education and improved sanitation (WASH)."
Yellow Fever,"A serious, potentially deadly flu-like disease spread by mosquitoes. It's characterized by a high fever and jaundice. Jaundice is yellowing of the skin and eyes, which is why the disease is called yellow fever.",Caused by a virus that is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Aedes and Haemagogus species mosquitoes. It is a viral hemorrhagic fever.,"The initial phase includes fever, chills, severe headache, back pain, muscle aches, nausea, and vomiting. Most people improve after this phase. However, about 15% enter a second, more toxic phase with high fever, jaundice, abdominal pain, and bleeding.","The most effective preventive measure is the yellow fever vaccine, which is safe, affordable, and provides lifelong protection. In at-risk areas, preventing mosquito bites by using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing is also crucial.","**Disclaimer: There is no specific antiviral medicine for yellow fever. Severe cases require hospitalization for supportive care.** Home care for mild cases involves rest, drinking fluids to prevent dehydration, and using pain relievers and fever reducers (but avoiding aspirin and NSAIDs, which can increase bleeding risk).","The yellow fever vaccine is a requirement for entry into certain countries. A single dose provides sustained immunity and lifelong protection, so a booster dose is no longer needed. Mosquito control programs are a vital part of preventing outbreaks.","WHO leads the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy. This global partnership aims to protect at-risk populations, prevent international spread, and contain outbreaks rapidly. A key component is ensuring a stable global supply and an emergency stockpile of the vaccine."
Zika Virus Infection,"A disease caused by a virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, which bite during the day. It can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sexual contact, and blood transfusion.","Caused by the Zika virus, a member of the Flavivirus genus. It is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue and chikungunya.","Many people infected with Zika virus won't have symptoms or will only have mild ones. Common symptoms include mild fever, rash, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). Symptoms usually last for several days to a week.","The best prevention is to protect against mosquito bites, especially in at-risk areas. Use insect repellents, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, and stay in places with air conditioning or that use window and door screens. To prevent sexual transmission, use condoms or abstain from sex.","**Disclaimer: There is no specific medicine or vaccine for Zika virus.** Treatment is focused on relieving symptoms. Get plenty of rest, drink fluids to prevent dehydration, and take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain. Avoid aspirin and NSAIDs until dengue can be ruled out.","The greatest concern with Zika is the link between infection during pregnancy and microcephaly, a severe birth defect where a baby is born with a smaller-than-normal head. Because of this risk, pregnant women are advised not to travel to areas with Zika outbreaks.",WHO monitors the global Zika situation and provides strategic direction and technical guidance to countries for surveillance and management. It has declared Zika and its associated complications a significant public health challenge and supports research into vaccines and diagnostics.
